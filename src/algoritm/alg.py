    sourceTextForCipher3 ="HE STOPPED TO DINNER THAT EVENING, AND, MUCH TO RUTH’S SATISFACTION, MADE A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION ON HER FATHER. THEY TALKED ABOUT THE SEA AS A CAREER, A SUBJECT WHICH MARTIN HAD AT HIS FINGER-ENDS, AND MR. MORSE REMARKED AFTERWARD THAT HE SEEMED A VERY CLEAR-HEADED YOUNG MAN. IN HIS AVOIDANCE OF SLANG AND HIS SEARCH AFTER RIGHT WORDS, MARTIN WAS COMPELLED TO TALK SLOWLY, WHICH ENABLED HIM TO FIND THE BEST THOUGHTS THAT WERE IN HIM. HE WAS MORE AT EASE THAN THAT FIRST NIGHT AT DINNER, NEARLY A YEAR BEFORE, AND HIS SHYNESS AND MODESTY EVEN COMMENDED HIM TO MRS. MORSE, WHO WAS PLEASED AT HIS MANIFEST IMPROVEMENT. HE IS THE FIRST MAN THAT EVER DREW PASSING NOTICE FROM RUTH,SHE TOLD HER HUSBAND. SHE HAS BEEN SO SINGULARLY BACKWARD WHERE MEN ARE CONCERNED THAT I HAVE BEEN WORRIED GREATLY.  MR. MORSE LOOKED AT HIS WIFE CURIOUSLY.   YOU MEAN TO USE THIS YOUNG SAILOR TO WAKE HER UP? HE QUESTIONED.   I MEAN THAT SHE IS NOT TO DIE AN OLD MAID IF I CAN HELP IT, WAS THE ANSWER. IF THIS YOUNG EDEN CAN AROUSE HER INTEREST IN MANKIND IN GENERAL, IT WILL BE A GOOD THING.   A VERY GOOD THING, HE COMMENTED. BUT SUPPOSE,-AND WE MUST SUPPOSE, SOMETIMES, MY DEAR,-SUPPOSE HE AROUSES HER INTEREST TOO PARTICULARLY IN HIM? IMPOSSIBLE, MRS. MORSE LAUGHED. SHE IS THREE YEARS OLDER THAN HE, AND, BESIDES, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. NOTHING WILL EVER COME OF IT. TRUST THAT TO ME.   AND SO MARTIN’S  WAS ARRANGED FOR HIM, WHILE HE, LED ON BY ARTHUR AND NORMAN, WAS MEDITATING AN EXTRAVAGANCE. THEY WERE GOING OUT FOR A RIDE INTO THE HILLS SUNDAY MORNING ON THEIR WHEELS, WHICH DID NOT INTEREST MARTIN UNTIL HE LEARNED THAT RUTH, TOO, RODE A WHEEL AND WAS GOING ALONG. HE DID NOT RIDE, NOR OWN A WHEEL, BUT IF RUTH RODE, IT WAS UP TO HIM TO BEGIN, WAS HIS DECISION; AND WHEN HE SAID GOOD NIGHT, HE STOPPED IN AT A CYCLERY ON HIS WAY HOME AND SPENT FORTY DOLLARS FOR A WHEEL. IT WAS MORE THAN A MONTH’S HARD-EARNED WAGES, AND IT REDUCED HIS STOCK OF MONEY AMAZINGLY; BUT WHEN HE ADDED THE HUNDRED DOLLARS HE WAS TO RECEIVE FROM THE EXAMINER TO THE FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS THAT WAS THE LEAST THE YOUTH’S COMPANION COULD PAY HIM, HE FELT THAT HE HAD REDUCED THE PERPLEXITY THE UNWONTED AMOUNT OF MONEY HAD CAUSED HIM. NOR DID HE MIND, IN THE COURSE OF LEARNING TO RIDE THE WHEEL HOME, THE FACT THAT HE RUINED HIS SUIT OF CLOTHES. HE CAUGHT THE TAILOR BY TELEPHONE THAT NIGHT FROM MR. HIGGINBOTHAM’S STORE AND ORDERED ANOTHER SUIT. THEN HE CARRIED THE WHEEL UP THE NARROW STAIRWAY THAT CLUNG LIKE A FIRE-ESCAPE TO THE REAR WALL OF THE BUILDING, AND WHEN HE HAD MOVED HIS BED OUT FROM THE WALL, FOUND THERE WAS JUST SPACE ENOUGH IN THE SMALL ROOM FOR HIMSELF AND THE WHEEL.   SUNDAY HE HAD INTENDED TO DEVOTE TO STUDYING FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL EXAMINATION, BUT THE PEARL-DIVING ARTICLE LURED HIM AWAY, AND HE SPENT THE DAY IN THE WHITE-HOT FEVER OF RE-CREATING THE BEAUTY AND ROMANCE THAT BURNED IN HIM. THE FACT THAT THE EXAMINER OF THAT MORNING HAD FAILED TO PUBLISH HIS TREASURE-HUNTING ARTICLE DID NOT DASH HIS SPIRITS. HE WAS AT TOO GREAT A HEIGHT FOR THAT, AND HAVING BEEN DEAF TO A TWICE-REPEATED SUMMONS, HE WENT WITHOUT THE HEAVY SUNDAY DINNER WITH WHICH MR. HIGGINBOTHAM INVARIABLY GRACED HIS TABLE. TO MR. HIGGINBOTHAM SUCH A DINNER WAS ADVERTISEMENT OF HIS WORLDLY ACHIEVEMENT AND PROSPERITY, AND HE HONORED IT BY DELIVERING PLATITUDINOUS SERMONETTES UPON AMERICAN INSTITUTIONS AND THE OPPORTUNITY SAID INSTITUTIONS GAVE TO ANY HARD-WORKING MAN TO RISE-THE RISE, IN HIS CASE, WHICH HE POINTED OUT UNFAILINGLY, BEING FROM A GROCER’S CLERK TO THE OWNERSHIP OF HIGGINBOTHAM’S CASH STORE.   MARTIN EDEN LOOKED WITH A SIGH AT HIS UNFINISHED PEARL-DIVING ON MONDAY MORNING, AND TOOK THE CAR DOWN TO OAKLAND TO THE HIGH SCHOOL. AND WHEN, DAYS LATER, HE APPLIED FOR THE RESULTS OF HIS EXAMINATIONS, HE LEARNED THAT HE HAD FAILED IN EVERYTHING SAVE GRAMMAR.   YOUR GRAMMAR IS EXCELLENT, PROFESSOR HILTON INFORMED HIM, STARING AT HIM THROUGH HEAVY SPECTACLES; BUT YOU KNOW NOTHING, POSITIVELY NOTHING, IN THE OTHER BRANCHES, AND YOUR UNITED STATES HISTORY IS ABOMINABLE-THERE IS NO OTHER WORD FOR IT, ABOMINABLE. I SHOULD ADVISE YOU-  PROFESSOR HILTON PAUSED AND GLARED AT HIM, UNSYMPATHETIC AND UNIMAGINATIVE AS ONE OF HIS OWN TEST-TUBES. HE WAS PROFESSOR OF PHYSICS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL, POSSESSOR OF A LARGE FAMILY, A MEAGRE SALARY, AND A SELECT FUND OF PARROT-LEARNED KNOWLEDGE.   YES, SIR, MARTIN SAID HUMBLY, WISHING SOMEHOW THAT THE MAN AT THE DESK IN THE LIBRARY WAS IN PROFESSOR HILTON’S PLACE JUST THEN.   AND I SHOULD ADVISE YOU TO GO BACK TO THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS. GOOD DAY.   MARTIN WAS NOT DEEPLY AFFECTED BY HIS FAILURE, THOUGH HE WAS SURPRISED AT RUTH’S SHOCKED EXPRESSION WHEN HE TOLD HER PROFESSOR HILTON’S ADVICE. HER DISAPPOINTMENT WAS SO EVIDENT THAT HE WAS SORRY HE HAD FAILED, BUT CHIEFLY SO FOR HER SAKE.   YOU SEE I WAS RIGHT, SHE SAID. YOU KNOW FAR MORE THAN ANY OF THE STUDENTS ENTERING HIGH SCHOOL, AND YET YOU CAN’T PASS THE EXAMINATIONS. IT IS BECAUSE WHAT EDUCATION YOU HAVE IS FRAGMENTARY, SKETCHY. YOU NEED THE DISCIPLINE OF STUDY, SUCH AS ONLY SKILLED TEACHERS CAN GIVE YOU. YOU MUST BE THOROUGHLY GROUNDED. PROFESSOR HILTON IS RIGHT, AND IF I WERE YOU, I’D GO TO NIGHT SCHOOL. A YEAR AND A HALF OF IT MIGHT ENABLE YOU TO CATCH UP THAT ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS. BESIDES, THAT WOULD LEAVE YOU YOUR DAYS IN WHICH TO WRITE, OR, IF YOU COULD NOT MAKE YOUR LIVING BY YOUR PEN, YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR DAYS IN WHICH TO WORK IN SOME POSITION.   BUT IF MY DAYS ARE TAKEN UP WITH WORK AND MY NIGHTS WITH SCHOOL, WHEN AM I GOING TO SEE YOU?-WAS MARTIN’S FIRST THOUGHT, THOUGH HE REFRAINED FROM UTTERING IT. INSTEAD, HE SAID:-   IT SEEMS SO BABYISH FOR ME TO BE GOING TO NIGHT SCHOOL. BUT I WOULDN’T MIND THAT IF I THOUGHT IT WOULD PAY. BUT I DON’T THINK IT WILL PAY. I CAN DO THE WORK QUICKER THAN THEY CAN TEACH ME. IT WOULD BE A LOSS OF TIME- HE THOUGHT OF HER AND HIS DESIRE TO HAVE HER-AND I CAN’T AFFORD THE TIME. I HAVEN’T THE TIME TO SPARE, IN FACT.   THERE IS SO MUCH THAT IS NECESSARY. SHE LOOKED AT HIM GENTLY, AND HE WAS A BRUTE TO OPPOSE HER. PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY-YOU CAN’T DO THEM WITHOUT LABORATORY STUDY; AND YOU’LL FIND ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY ALMOST HOPELESS WITH INSTRUCTION. YOU NEED THE SKILLED TEACHERS, THE SPECIALISTS IN THE ART OF IMPARTING KNOWLEDGE.   HE WAS SILENT FOR A MINUTE, CASTING ABOUT FOR THE LEAST VAINGLORIOUS WAY IN WHICH TO EXPRESS HIMSELF.   PLEASE DON’T THINK I’M BRAGGING, HE BEGAN. I DON’T INTEND IT THAT WAY AT ALL. BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT I AM WHAT I MAY CALL A NATURAL STUDENT. I CAN STUDY BY MYSELF. I TAKE TO IT KINDLY, LIKE A DUCK TO WATER. YOU SEE YOURSELF WHAT I DID WITH GRAMMAR. AND I’VE LEARNED MUCH OF OTHER THINGS-YOU WOULD NEVER DREAM HOW MUCH. AND I’M ONLY GETTING STARTED. WAIT TILL I GET- HE HESITATED AND ASSURED HIMSELF OF THE PRONUNCIATION BEFORE HE SAID MOMENTUM. I’M GETTING MY FIRST REAL FEEL OF THINGS NOW. I’M BEGINNING TO SIZE UP THE SITUATION-   PLEASE DON’T SAY ‘SIZE UP,’ SHE INTERRUPTED.   TO GET A LINE ON THINGS, HE HASTILY AMENDED.   THAT DOESN’T MEAN ANYTHING IN CORRECT ENGLISH, SHE OBJECTED.   HE FLOUNDERED FOR A FRESH START. WHAT I’M DRIVING AT IS THAT I’M BEGINNING TO GET THE LAY OF THE LAND   OUT OF PITY SHE FOREBORE, AND HE WENT ON.   KNOWLEDGE SEEMS TO ME LIKE A CHART-ROOM. WHENEVER I GO INTO THE LIBRARY, I AM IMPRESSED THAT WAY. THE PART PLAYED BY TEACHERS IS TO TEACH THE STUDENT THE CONTENTS OF THE CHART-ROOM IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY. THE TEACHERS ARE GUIDES TO THE CHART-ROOM, THAT’S ALL. IT’S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR OWN HEADS. THEY DON’T MAKE IT UP, DON’T CREATE IT. IT’S ALL IN THE CHART-ROOM AND THEY KNOW THEIR WAY ABOUT IN IT, AND IT’S THEIR BUSINESS TO SHOW THE PLACE TO STRANGERS WHO MIGHT ELSE GET LOST. NOW I DON’T GET LOST EASILY. I HAVE THE BUMP OF LOCATION. I USUALLY KNOW WHERE I’M AT-WHAT’S WRONG NOW?   DON’T SAY ‘WHERE I’M AT.’   THAT’S RIGHT, HE SAID GRATEFULLY, WHERE I AM. BUT WHERE AM I AT-I MEAN, WHERE AM I? OH, YES, IN THE CHART-ROOM. WELL, SOME PEOPLE-   PERSONS, SHE CORRECTED.   SOME PERSONS NEED GUIDES, MOST PERSONS DO; BUT I THINK I CAN GET ALONG WITHOUT THEM. I’VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE CHART-ROOM NOW, AND I’M ON THE EDGE OF KNOWING MY WAY ABOUT, WHAT CHARTS I WANT TO REFER TO, WHAT COASTS I WANT TO EXPLORE. AND FROM THE WAY I LINE IT UP, I’LL EXPLORE A WHOLE LOT MORE QUICKLY BY MYSELF. THE SPEED OF A FLEET, YOU KNOW, IS THE SPEED OF THE SLOWEST SHIP, AND THE SPEED OF THE TEACHERS IS AFFECTED THE SAME WAY. THEY CAN’T GO ANY FASTER THAN THE RUCK OF THEIR SCHOLARS, AND I CAN SET A FASTER PACE FOR MYSELF THAN THEY SET FOR A WHOLE SCHOOLROOM.   ‘HE TRAVELS THE FASTEST WHO TRAVELS ALONE,’ SHE QUOTED AT HIM.   BUT I’D TRAVEL FASTER WITH YOU JUST THE SAME, WAS WHAT HE WANTED TO BLURT OUT, AS HE CAUGHT A VISION OF A WORLD WITHOUT END OF SUNLIT SPACES AND STARRY VOIDS THROUGH WHICH HE DRIFTED WITH HER, HIS ARM AROUND HER, HER PALE GOLD HAIR BLOWING ABOUT HIS FACE. IN THE SAME INSTANT HE WAS AWARE OF THE PITIFUL INADEQUACY OF SPEECH. GOD! IF HE COULD SO FRAME WORDS THAT SHE COULD SEE WHAT HE THEN SAW! AND HE FELT THE STIR IN HIM, LIKE A THROE OF YEARNING PAIN, OF THE DESIRE TO PAINT THESE VISIONS THAT FLASHED UNSUMMONED ON THE MIRROR OF HIS MIND. AH, THAT WAS IT! HE CAUGHT AT THE HEM OF THE SECRET. IT WAS THE VERY THING THAT THE GREAT WRITERS AND MASTER-POETS DID. THAT WAS WHY THEY WERE GIANTS. THEY KNEW HOW TO EXPRESS WHAT THEY THOUGHT, AND FELT, AND SAW. DOGS ASLEEP IN THE SUN OFTEN WHINED AND BARKED, BUT THEY WERE UNABLE TO TELL WHAT THEY SAW THAT MADE THEM WHINE AND BARK. HE HAD OFTEN WONDERED WHAT IT WAS. AND THAT WAS ALL HE WAS, A DOG ASLEEP IN THE SUN. HE SAW NOBLE AND BEAUTIFUL VISIONS, BUT HE COULD ONLY WHINE AND BARK AT RUTH. BUT HE WOULD CEASE SLEEPING IN THE SUN. HE WOULD STAND UP, WITH OPEN EYES, AND HE WOULD STRUGGLE AND TOIL AND LEARN UNTIL, WITH EYES UNBLINDED AND TONGUE UNTIED, HE COULD SHARE WITH HER HIS VISIONED WEALTH. OTHER MEN HAD DISCOVERED THE TRICK OF EXPRESSION, OF MAKING WORDS OBEDIENT SERVITORS, AND OF MAKING COMBINATIONS OF WORDS MEAN MORE THAN THE SUM OF THEIR SEPARATE MEANINGS. HE WAS STIRRED PROFOUNDLY BY THE PASSING GLIMPSE AT THE SECRET, AND HE WAS AGAIN CAUGHT UP IN THE VISION OF SUNLIT SPACES AND STARRY VOIDS-UNTIL IT CAME TO HIM THAT IT WAS VERY QUIET, AND HE SAW RUTH REGARDING HIM WITH AN AMUSED EXPRESSION AND A SMILE IN HER EYES.   I HAVE HAD A GREAT VISIONING, HE SAID, AND AT THE SOUND OF HIS WORDS IN HIS OWN EARS HIS HEART GAVE A LEAP. WHERE HAD THOSE WORDS COME FROM? THEY HAD ADEQUATELY EXPRESSED THE PAUSE HIS VISION HAD PUT IN THE CONVERSATION. IT WAS A MIRACLE. NEVER HAD HE SO LOFTILY FRAMED A LOFTY THOUGHT. BUT NEVER HAD HE ATTEMPTED TO FRAME LOFTY THOUGHTS IN WORDS. THAT WAS IT. THAT EXPLAINED IT. HE HAD NEVER TRIED. BUT SWINBURNE HAD, AND TENNYSON, AND KIPLING, AND ALL THE OTHER POETS. HIS MIND FLASHED ON TO HIS PEARL-DIVING. HE HAD NEVER DARED THE BIG THINGS, THE SPIRIT OF THE BEAUTY THAT WAS A FIRE IN HIM. THAT ARTICLE WOULD BE A DIFFERENT THING WHEN HE WAS DONE WITH IT. HE WAS APPALLED BY THE VASTNESS OF THE BEAUTY THAT RIGHTFULLY BELONGED IN IT, AND AGAIN HIS MIND FLASHED AND DARED, AND HE DEMANDED OF HIMSELF WHY HE COULD NOT CHANT THAT BEAUTY IN NOBLE VERSE AS THE GREAT POETS DID. AND THERE WAS ALL THE MYSTERIOUS DELIGHT AND SPIRITUAL WONDER OF HIS LOVE FOR RUTH. WHY COULD HE NOT CHANT THAT, TOO, AS THE POETS DID? THEY HAD SUNG OF LOVE. SO WOULD HE. BY GOD!-   AND IN HIS FRIGHTENED EARS HE HEARD HIS EXCLAMATION ECHOING. CARRIED AWAY, HE HAD BREATHED IT ALOUD. THE BLOOD SURGED INTO HIS FACE, WAVE UPON WAVE, MASTERING THE BRONZE OF IT TILL THE BLUSH OF SHAME FLAUNTED ITSELF FROM COLLAR-RIM TO THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR.   I– I-BEG YOUR PARDON, HE STAMMERED. I WAS THINKING.   IT SOUNDED AS IF YOU WERE PRAYING, SHE SAID BRAVELY, BUT SHE FELT HERSELF INSIDE TO BE WITHERING AND SHRINKING. IT WAS THE FIRST TIME SHE HAD HEARD AN OATH FROM THE LIPS OF A MAN SHE KNEW, AND SHE WAS SHOCKED, NOT MERELY AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE AND TRAINING, BUT SHOCKED IN SPIRIT BY THIS ROUGH BLAST OF LIFE IN THE GARDEN OF HER SHELTERED MAIDENHOOD.   BUT SHE FORGAVE, AND WITH SURPRISE AT THE EASE OF HER FORGIVENESS. SOMEHOW IT WAS NOT SO DIFFICULT TO FORGIVE HIM ANYTHING. HE HAD NOT HAD A CHANCE TO BE AS OTHER MEN, AND HE WAS TRYING SO HARD, AND SUCCEEDING, TOO. IT NEVER ENTERED HER HEAD THAT THERE COULD BE ANY OTHER REASON FOR HER BEING KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARD HIM. SHE WAS TENDERLY DISPOSED TOWARD HIM, BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW IT. SHE HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING IT. THE PLACID POISE OF TWENTY-FOUR YEARS WITHOUT A SINGLE LOVE AFFAIR DID NOT FIT HER WITH A KEEN PERCEPTION OF HER OWN FEELINGS, AND SHE WHO HAD NEVER WARMED TO ACTUAL LOVE WAS UNAWARE THAT SHE WAS WARMING NOW."
    sourceText = u"SCROOGE WAS BETTER THAN HIS WORD. HE DID IT ALL, AND INFINITELY MORE; AND TO TINY TIM, WHO DID NOT DIE, HE WAS A SECOND FATHER. HE BECAME AS GOOD A FRIEND, AS GOOD A MASTER, AND AS GOOD A MAN, AS THE GOOD OLD CITY KNEW, OR ANY OTHER GOOD OLD CITY, TOWN, OR BOROUGH, IN THE GOOD OLD WORLD. SOME PEOPLE LAUGHED TO SEE THE ALTERATION IN HIM, BUT HE LET THEM LAUGH, AND LITTLE HEEDED THEM; FOR HE WAS WISE ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT NOTHING EVER HAPPENED ON THIS GLOBE, FOR GOOD, AT WHICH SOME PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE THEIR FILL OF LAUGHTER IN THE OUTSET; AND KNOWING THAT SUCH AS THESE WOULD BE BLIND ANYWAY, HE THOUGHT IT QUITE AS WELL THAT THEY SHOULD WRINKLE UP THEIR EYES IN GRINS, AS HAVE THE MALADY IN LESS ATTRACTIVE FORMS. HIS OWN HEART LAUGHED: AND THAT WAS QUITE ENOUGH FOR HIM. HE HAD NO FURTHER INTERCOURSE WITH SPIRITS, BUT LIVED UPON THE TOTAL ABSTINENCE PRINCIPLE, EVER AFTERWARDS; AND IT WAS ALWAYS SAID OF HIM, THAT HE KNEW HOW TO KEEP CHRISTMAS WELL, IF ANY MAN ALIVE POSSESSED THE KNOWLEDGE. MAY THAT BE TRULY SAID OF US, AND ALL OF US! AND SO, AS TINY TIM OBSERVED, GOD BLESS US, EVERY ONE!"

    sourceTextForCipher4 = u" THAT RUTH HAD LITTLE FAITH IN HIS POWER AS A WRITER, DID NOT ALTER HER NOR DIMINISH HER IN MARTIN’S EYES. IN THE BREATHING SPELL OF THE VACATION HE HAD TAKEN, HE HAD SPENT MANY HOURS IN SELF-ANALYSIS, AND THEREBY LEARNED MUCH OF HIMSELF. HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT HE LOVED BEAUTY MORE THAN FAME, AND THAT WHAT DESIRE HE HAD FOR FAME WAS LARGELY FOR RUTH’S SAKE. IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT HIS DESIRE FOR FAME WAS STRONG. HE WANTED TO BE GREAT IN THE WORLD’S EYES; TO MAKE GOOD, AS HE EXPRESSED IT, IN ORDER THAT THE WOMAN HE LOVED SHOULD BE PROUD OF HIM AND DEEM HIM WORTHY.   AS FOR HIMSELF, HE LOVED BEAUTY PASSIONATELY, AND THE JOY OF SERVING HER WAS TO HIM SUFFICIENT WAGE. AND MORE THAN BEAUTY HE LOVED RUTH. HE CONSIDERED LOVE THE FINEST THING IN THE WORLD. IT WAS LOVE THAT HAD WORKED THE REVOLUTION IN HIM, CHANGING HIM FROM AN UNCOUTH SAILOR TO A STUDENT AND AN ARTIST; THEREFORE, TO HIM, THE FINEST AND GREATEST OF THE THREE, GREATER THAN LEARNING AND ARTISTRY, WAS LOVE. ALREADY HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT HIS BRAIN WENT BEYOND RUTH’S, JUST AS IT WENT BEYOND THE BRAINS OF HER BROTHERS, OR THE BRAIN OF HER FATHER. IN SPITE OF EVERY ADVANTAGE OF UNIVERSITY TRAINING, AND IN THE FACE OF HER BACHELORSHIP OF ARTS, HIS POWER OF INTELLECT OVERSHADOWED HERS, AND HIS YEAR OR SO OF SELF-STUDY AND EQUIPMENT GAVE HIM A MASTERY OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD AND ART AND LIFE THAT SHE COULD NEVER HOPE TO POSSESS.   ALL THIS HE REALIZED, BUT IT DID NOT AFFECT HIS LOVE FOR HER, NOR HER LOVE FOR HIM. LOVE WAS TOO FINE AND NOBLE, AND HE WAS TOO LOYAL A LOVER FOR HIM TO BESMIRCH LOVE WITH CRITICISM. WHAT DID LOVE HAVE TO DO WITH RUTH’S DIVERGENT VIEWS ON ART, RIGHT CONDUCT, THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, OR EQUAL SUFFRAGE? THEY WERE MENTAL PROCESSES, BUT LOVE WAS BEYOND REASON; IT WAS SUPERRATIONAL. HE COULD NOT BELITTLE LOVE. HE WORSHIPPED IT. LOVE LAY ON THE MOUNTAIN-TOPS BEYOND THE VALLEY-LAND OF REASON. IT WAS A SUBLIMATES CONDITION OF EXISTENCE, THE TOPMOST PEAK OF LIVING, AND IT CAME RARELY. THANKS TO THE SCHOOL OF SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHERS HE FAVORED, HE KNEW THE BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF LOVE; BUT BY A REFINED PROCESS OF THE SAME SCIENTIFIC REASONING HE REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT THE HUMAN ORGANISM ACHIEVED ITS HIGHEST PURPOSE IN LOVE, THAT LOVE MUST NOT BE QUESTIONED, BUT MUST BE ACCEPTED AS THE HIGHEST GUERDON OF LIFE. THUS, HE CONSIDERED THE LOVER BLESSED OVER ALL CREATURES, AND IT WAS A DELIGHT TO HIM TO THINK OF GOD’S OWN MAD LOVER, RISING ABOVE THE THINGS OF EARTH, ABOVE WEALTH AND JUDGMENT, PUBLIC OPINION AND APPLAUSE, RISING ABOVE LIFE ITSELF AND DYING ON A KISS.   MUCH OF THIS MARTIN HAD ALREADY REASONED OUT, AND SOME OF IT HE REASONED OUT LATER. IN THE MEANTIME HE WORKED, TAKING NO RECREATION EXCEPT WHEN HE WENT TO SEE RUTH, AND LIVING LIKE A SPARTAN. HE PAID TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF A MONTH RENT FOR THE SMALL ROOM HE GOT FROM HIS PORTUGUESE LANDLADY, MARIA SILVA, A VIRAGO AND A WIDOW, HARD WORKING AND HARSHER TEMPERED, REARING HER LARGE BROOD OF CHILDREN SOMEHOW, AND DROWNING HER SORROW AND FATIGUE AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS IN A GALLON OF THE THIN, SOUR WINE THAT SHE BOUGHT FROM THE CORNER GROCERY AND SALOON FOR FIFTEEN CENTS. FROM DETESTING HER AND HER FOUL TONGUE AT FIRST, MARTIN GREW TO ADMIRE HER AS HE OBSERVED THE BRAVE FIGHT SHE MADE. THERE WERE BUT FOUR ROOMS IN THE LITTLE HOUSE-THREE, WHEN MARTIN’S WAS SUBTRACTED. ONE OF THESE, THE PARLOR, GAY WITH AN INGRAIN CARPET AND DOLOROUS WITH A FUNERAL CARD AND A DEATH-PICTURE OF ONE OF HER NUMEROUS DEPARTED BABES, WAS KEPT STRICTLY FOR COMPANY. THE BLINDS WERE ALWAYS DOWN, AND HER BAREFOOTED TRIBE WAS NEVER PERMITTED TO ENTER THE SACRED PRECINCT SAVE ON STATE OCCASIONS. SHE COOKED, AND ALL ATE, IN THE KITCHEN, WHERE SHE LIKEWISE WASHED, STARCHED, AND IRONED CLOTHES ON ALL DAYS OF THE WEEK EXCEPT SUNDAY; FOR HER INCOME CAME LARGELY FROM TAKING IN WASHING FROM HER MORE PROSPEROUS NEIGHBORS. REMAINED THE BEDROOM, SMALL AS THE ONE OCCUPIED BY MARTIN, INTO WHICH SHE AND HER SEVEN LITTLE ONES CROWDED AND SLEPT. IT WAS AN EVERLASTING MIRACLE TO MARTIN HOW IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED, AND FROM HER SIDE OF THE THIN PARTITION HE HEARD NIGHTLY EVERY DETAIL OF THE GOING TO BED, THE SQUALLS AND SQUABBLES, THE SOFT CHATTERING, AND THE SLEEPY, TWITTERING NOISES AS OF BIRDS. ANOTHER SOURCE OF INCOME TO MARIA WERE HER COWS, TWO OF THEM, WHICH SHE MILKED NIGHT AND MORNING AND WHICH GAINED A SURREPTITIOUS LIVELIHOOD FROM VACANT LOTS AND THE GRASS THAT GREW ON EITHER SIDE THE PUBLIC SIDE WALKS, ATTENDED ALWAYS BY ONE OR MORE OF HER RAGGED BOYS, WHOSE WATCHFUL GUARDIANSHIP CONSISTED CHIEFLY IN KEEPING THEIR EYES OUT FOR THE POUNDMEN.   IN HIS OWN SMALL ROOM MARTIN LIVED, SLEPT, STUDIED, WROTE, AND KEPT HOUSE. BEFORE THE ONE WINDOW, LOOKING OUT ON THE TINY FRONT PORCH, WAS THE KITCHEN TABLE THAT SERVED AS DESK, LIBRARY, AND TYPE-WRITING STAND. THE BED, AGAINST THE REAR WALL, OCCUPIED TWO-THIRDS OF THE TOTAL SPACE OF THE ROOM. THE TABLE WAS FLANKED ON ONE SIDE BY A GAUDY BUREAU, MANUFACTURED FOR PROFIT AND NOT FOR SERVICE, THE THIN VENEER OF WHICH WAS SHED DAY BY DAY. THIS BUREAU STOOD IN THE CORNER, AND IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER, ON THE TABLE’S OTHER FLANK, WAS THE KITCHEN-THE OIL-STOVE ON A DRY-GOODS BOX, INSIDE OF WHICH WERE DISHES AND COOKING UTENSILS, A SHELF ON THE WALL FOR PROVISIONS, AND A BUCKET OF WATER ON THE FLOOR. MARTIN HAD TO CARRY HIS WATER FROM THE KITCHEN SINK, THERE BEING NO TAP IN HIS ROOM. ON DAYS WHEN THERE WAS MUCH STEAM TO HIS COOKING, THE HARVEST OF VENEER FROM THE BUREAU WAS UNUSUALLY GENEROUS. OVER THE BED, HOISTED BY A TACKLE TO THE CEILING, WAS HIS BICYCLE. AT FIRST HE HAD TRIED TO KEEP IT IN THE BASEMENT; BUT THE TRIBE OF SILVA, LOOSENING THE BEARINGS AND PUNCTURING THE TIRES, HAD DRIVEN HIM OUT. NEXT HE ATTEMPTED THE TINY FRONT PORCH, UNTIL A HOWLING SOUTHEASTER DRENCHED THE WHEEL A NIGHT-LONG. THEN HE HAD RETREATED WITH IT TO HIS ROOM AND SLUNG IT ALOFT.   A SMALL CLOSET CONTAINED HIS CLOTHES AND THE BOOKS HE HAD ACCUMULATED AND FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO ROOM ON THE TABLE OR UNDER THE TABLE. HAND IN HAND WITH READING, HE HAD DEVELOPED THE HABIT OF MAKING NOTES, AND SO COPIOUSLY DID HE MAKE THEM THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO EXISTENCE FOR HIM IN THE CONFINED QUARTERS HAD HE NOT RIGGED SEVERAL CLOTHES-LINES ACROSS THE ROOM ON WHICH THE NOTES WERE HUNG. EVEN SO, HE WAS CROWDED UNTIL NAVIGATING THE ROOM WAS A DIFFICULT TASK. HE COULD NOT OPEN THE DOOR WITHOUT FIRST CLOSING THE CLOSET DOOR, AND VICE VERSA . IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM ANYWHERE TO TRAVERSE THE ROOM IN A STRAIGHT LINE. TO GO FROM THE DOOR TO THE HEAD OF THE BED WAS A ZIGZAG COURSE THAT HE WAS NEVER QUITE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE DARK WITHOUT COLLISIONS. HAVING SETTLED THE DIFFICULTY OF THE CONFLICTING DOORS, HE HAD TO STEER SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT TO AVOID THE KITCHEN. NEXT, HE SHEERED TO THE LEFT, TO ESCAPE THE FOOT OF THE BED; BUT THIS SHEER, IF TOO GENEROUS, BROUGHT HIM AGAINST THE CORNER OF THE TABLE. WITH A SUDDEN TWITCH AND LURCH, HE TERMINATED THE SHEER AND BORE OFF TO THE RIGHT ALONG A SORT OF CANAL, ONE BANK OF WHICH WAS THE BED, THE OTHER THE TABLE. WHEN THE ONE CHAIR IN THE ROOM WAS AT ITS USUAL PLACE BEFORE THE TABLE, THE CANAL WAS UNNAVIGABLE. WHEN THE CHAIR WAS NOT IN USE, IT REPOSED ON TOP OF THE BED, THOUGH SOMETIMES HE SAT ON THE CHAIR WHEN COOKING, READING A BOOK WHILE THE WATER BOILED, AND EVEN BECOMING SKILFUL ENOUGH TO MANAGE A PARAGRAPH OR TWO WHILE STEAK WAS FRYING. ALSO, SO SMALL WAS THE LITTLE CORNER THAT CONSTITUTED THE KITCHEN, HE WAS ABLE, SITTING DOWN, TO REACH ANYTHING HE NEEDED. IN FACT, IT WAS EXPEDIENT TO COOK SITTING DOWN; STANDING UP, HE WAS TOO OFTEN IN HIS OWN WAY.   IN CONJUNCTION WITH A PERFECT STOMACH THAT COULD DIGEST ANYTHING, HE POSSESSED KNOWLEDGE OF THE VARIOUS FOODS THAT WERE AT THE SAME TIME NUTRITIOUS AND CHEAP. PEA-SOUP WAS A COMMON ARTICLE IN HIS DIET, AS WELL AS POTATOES AND BEANS, THE LATTER LARGE AND BROWN AND COOKED IN MEXICAN STYLE. RICE, COOKED AS AMERICAN HOUSEWIVES NEVER COOK IT AND CAN NEVER LEARN TO COOK IT, APPEARED ON MARTIN’S TABLE AT LEAST ONCE A DAY. DRIED FRUITS WERE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN FRESH, AND HE HAD USUALLY A POT OF THEM, COOKED AND READY AT HAND, FOR THEY TOOK THE PLACE OF BUTTER ON HIS BREAD. OCCASIONALLY HE GRACED HIS TABLE WITH A PIECE OF ROUND-STEAK, OR WITH A SOUP-BONE. COFFEE, WITHOUT CREAM OR MILK, HE HAD TWICE A DAY, IN THE EVENING SUBSTITUTING TEA; BUT BOTH COFFEE AND TEA WERE EXCELLENTLY COOKED.   THERE WAS NEED FOR HIM TO BE ECONOMICAL. HIS VACATION HAD CONSUMED NEARLY ALL HE HAD EARNED IN THE LAUNDRY, AND HE WAS SO FAR FROM HIS MARKET THAT WEEKS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE HE COULD HOPE FOR THE FIRST RETURNS FROM HIS HACK-WORK. EXCEPT AT SUCH TIMES AS HE SAW RUTH, OR DROPPED IN TO SEE HIS SISTER GERTUDE, HE LIVED A RECLUSE, IN EACH DAY ACCOMPLISHING AT LEAST THREE DAYS’ LABOR OF ORDINARY MEN. HE SLEPT A SCANT FIVE HOURS, AND ONLY ONE WITH A CONSTITUTION OF IRON COULD HAVE HELD HIMSELF DOWN, AS MARTIN DID, DAY AFTER DAY, TO NINETEEN CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF TOIL. HE NEVER LOST A MOMENT. ON THE LOOKING-GLASS WERE LISTS OF DEFINITIONS AND PRONUNCIATIONS; WHEN SHAVING, OR DRESSING, OR COMBING HIS HAIR, HE CONNED THESE LISTS OVER. SIMILAR LISTS WERE ON THE WALL OVER THE OIL-STOVE, AND THEY WERE SIMILARLY CONNED WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED IN COOKING OR IN WASHING THE DISHES. NEW LISTS CONTINUALLY DISPLACED THE OLD ONES. EVERY STRANGE OR PARTLY FAMILIAR WORD ENCOUNTERED IN HIS READING WAS IMMEDIATELY JOTTED DOWN, AND LATER, WHEN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER HAD BEEN ACCUMULATED, WERE TYPED AND PINNED TO THE WALL OR LOOKING-GLASS. HE EVEN CARRIED THEM IN HIS POCKETS, AND REVIEWED THEM AT ODD MOMENTS ON THE STREET, OR WHILE WAITING IN BUTCHER SHOP OR GROCERY TO BE SERVED.   HE WENT FARTHER IN THE MATTER. READING THE WORKS OF MEN WHO HAD ARRIVED, HE NOTED EVERY RESULT ACHIEVED BY THEM, AND WORKED OUT THE TRICKS BY WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ACHIEVED-THE TRICKS OF NARRATIVE, OF EXPOSITION, OF STYLE, THE POINTS OF VIEW, THE CONTRASTS, THE EPIGRAMS; AND OF ALL THESE HE MADE LISTS FOR STUDY. HE DID NOT APE. HE SOUGHT PRINCIPLES. HE DREW UP LISTS OF EFFECTIVE AND FETCHING MANNERISMS, TILL OUT OF MANY SUCH, CULLED FROM MANY WRITERS, HE WAS ABLE TO INDUCE THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF MANNERISM, AND, THUS EQUIPPED, TO CAST ABOUT FOR NEW AND ORIGINAL ONES OF HIS OWN, AND TO WEIGH AND MEASURE AND APPRAISE THEM PROPERLY. IN SIMILAR MANNER HE COLLECTED LISTS OF STRONG PHRASES, THE PHRASES OF LIVING LANGUAGE, PHRASES THAT BIT LIKE ACID AND SCORCHED LIKE FLAME, OR THAT GLOWED AND WERE MELLOW AND LUSCIOUS IN THE MIDST OF THE ARID DESERT OF COMMON SPEECH. HE SOUGHT ALWAYS FOR THE PRINCIPLE THAT LAY BEHIND AND BENEATH. HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW THE THING WAS DONE; AFTER THAT HE COULD DO IT FOR HIMSELF. HE WAS NOT CONTENT WITH THE FAIR FACE OF BEAUTY. HE DISSECTED BEAUTY IN HIS CROWDED LITTLE BEDROOM LABORATORY, WHERE COOKING SMELLS ALTERNATED WITH THE OUTER BEDLAM OF THE SILVA TRIBE; AND, HAVING DISSECTED AND LEARNED THE ANATOMY OF BEAUTY, HE WAS NEARER BEING ABLE TO CREATE BEAUTY ITSELF.   HE WAS SO MADE THAT HE COULD WORK ONLY WITH UNDERSTANDING. HE COULD NOT WORK BLINDLY, IN THE DARK, IGNORANT OF WHAT HE WAS PRODUCING AND TRUSTING TO CHANCE AND THE STAR OF HIS GENIUS THAT THE EFFECT PRODUCED SHOULD BE RIGHT AND FINE. HE HAD NO PATIENCE WITH CHANCE EFFECTS. HE WANTED TO KNOW WHY AND HOW. HIS WAS DELIBERATE CREATIVE GENIUS, AND, BEFORE HE BEGAN A STORY OR POEM, THE THING ITSELF WAS ALREADY ALIVE IN HIS BRAIN, WITH THE END IN SIGHT AND THE MEANS OF REALIZING THAT END IN HIS CONSCIOUS POSSESSION. OTHERWISE THE EFFORT WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE APPRECIATED THE CHANCE EFFECTS IN WORDS AND PHRASES THAT CAME LIGHTLY AND EASILY INTO HIS BRAIN, AND THAT LATER STOOD ALL TESTS OF BEAUTY AND POWER AND DEVELOPED TREMENDOUS AND INCOMMUNICABLE CONNOTATIONS. BEFORE SUCH HE BOWED DOWN AND MARVELLED, KNOWING THAT THEY WERE BEYOND THE DELIBERATE CREATION OF ANY MAN. AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE DISSECTED BEAUTY IN SEARCH OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT UNDERLIE BEAUTY AND MAKE BEAUTY POSSIBLE, HE WAS AWARE, ALWAYS, OF THE INNERMOST MYSTERY OF BEAUTY TO WHICH HE DID NOT PENETRATE AND TO WHICH NO MAN HAD EVER PENETRATED. HE KNEW FULL WELL, FROM HIS SPENCER, THAT MAN CAN NEVER ATTAIN ULTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING, AND THAT THE MYSTERY OF BEAUTY WAS NO LESS THAN THAT OF LIFE-NAY, MORE THAT THE FIBRES OF BEAUTY AND LIFE WERE INTERTWISTED, AND THAT HE HIMSELF WAS BUT A BIT OF THE SAME NONUNDERSTANDABLE FABRIC, TWISTED OF SUNSHINE AND STAR-DUST AND WONDER.   IN FACT, IT WAS WHEN FILLED WITH THESE THOUGHTS THAT HE WROTE HIS ESSAY ENTITLED STAR-DUST, IN WHICH HE HAD HIS FLING, NOT AT THE PRINCIPLES OF CRITICISM, BUT AT THE PRINCIPAL CRITICS. IT WAS BRILLIANT, DEEP, PHILOSOPHICAL, AND DELICIOUSLY TOUCHED WITH LAUGHTER. ALSO IT WAS PROMPTLY REJECTED BY THE MAGAZINES AS OFTEN AS IT WAS SUBMITTED. BUT HAVING CLEARED HIS MIND OF IT, HE WENT SERENELY ON HIS WAY. IT WAS A HABIT HE DEVELOPED, OF INCUBATING AND MATURING HIS THOUGHT UPON A SUBJECT, AND OF THEN RUSHING INTO THE TYPE-WRITER WITH IT. THAT IT DID NOT SEE PRINT WAS A MATTER A SMALL MOMENT WITH HIM. THE WRITING OF IT WAS THE CULMINATING ACT OF A LONG MENTAL PROCESS, THE DRAWING TOGETHER OF SCATTERED THREADS OF THOUGHT AND THE FINAL GENERALIZING UPON ALL THE DATA WITH WHICH HIS MIND WAS BURDENED. TO WRITE SUCH AN ARTICLE WAS THE CONSCIOUS EFFORT BY WHICH HE FREED HIS MIND AND MADE IT READY FOR FRESH MATERIAL AND PROBLEMS. IT WAS IN A WAY AKIN TO THAT COMMON HABIT OF MEN AND WOMEN TROUBLED BY REAL OR FANCIED GRIEVANCES, WHO PERIODICALLY AND VOLUBLY BREAK THEIR LONG-SUFFERING SILENCE AND HAVE THEIR SAY TILL THE LAST WORD IS SAID."
