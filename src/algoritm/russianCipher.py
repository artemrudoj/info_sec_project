    text = u"Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for him. He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total Abstinence Principle, ever afterwards; and it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!"
    textArtem = u"THAT RUTH HAD LITTLE FAITH IN HIS POWER AS A WRITER, DID NOT ALTER HER NOR DIMINISH HER IN MARTIN’S EYES. IN THE BREATHING SPELL OF THE VACATION HE HAD TAKEN, HE HAD SPENT MANY HOURS IN SELF-ANALYSIS, AND THEREBY LEARNED MUCH OF HIMSELF. HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT HE LOVED BEAUTY MORE THAN FAME, AND THAT WHAT DESIRE HE HAD FOR FAME WAS LARGELY FOR RUTH’S SAKE. IT WAS FOR THIS REASON THAT HIS DESIRE FOR FAME WAS STRONG. HE WANTED TO BE GREAT IN THE WORLD’S EYES; TO MAKE GOOD, AS HE EXPRESSED IT, IN ORDER THAT THE WOMAN HE LOVED SHOULD BE PROUD OF HIM AND DEEM HIM WORTHY.   AS FOR HIMSELF, HE LOVED BEAUTY PASSIONATELY, AND THE JOY OF SERVING HER WAS TO HIM SUFFICIENT WAGE. AND MORE THAN BEAUTY HE LOVED RUTH. HE CONSIDERED LOVE THE FINEST THING IN THE WORLD. IT WAS LOVE THAT HAD WORKED THE REVOLUTION IN HIM, CHANGING HIM FROM AN UNCOUTH SAILOR TO A STUDENT AND AN ARTIST; THEREFORE, TO HIM, THE FINEST AND GREATEST OF THE THREE, GREATER THAN LEARNING AND ARTISTRY, WAS LOVE. ALREADY HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT HIS BRAIN WENT BEYOND RUTH’S, JUST AS IT WENT BEYOND THE BRAINS OF HER BROTHERS, OR THE BRAIN OF HER FATHER. IN SPITE OF EVERY ADVANTAGE OF UNIVERSITY TRAINING, AND IN THE FACE OF HER BACHELORSHIP OF ARTS, HIS POWER OF INTELLECT OVERSHADOWED HERS, AND HIS YEAR OR SO OF SELF-STUDY AND EQUIPMENT GAVE HIM A MASTERY OF THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD AND ART AND LIFE THAT SHE COULD NEVER HOPE TO POSSESS.   ALL THIS HE REALIZED, BUT IT DID NOT AFFECT HIS LOVE FOR HER, NOR HER LOVE FOR HIM. LOVE WAS TOO FINE AND NOBLE, AND HE WAS TOO LOYAL A LOVER FOR HIM TO BESMIRCH LOVE WITH CRITICISM. WHAT DID LOVE HAVE TO DO WITH RUTH’S DIVERGENT VIEWS ON ART, RIGHT CONDUCT, THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, OR EQUAL SUFFRAGE? THEY WERE MENTAL PROCESSES, BUT LOVE WAS BEYOND REASON; IT WAS SUPERRATIONAL. HE COULD NOT BELITTLE LOVE. HE WORSHIPPED IT. LOVE LAY ON THE MOUNTAIN-TOPS BEYOND THE VALLEY-LAND OF REASON. IT WAS A SUBLIMATES CONDITION OF EXISTENCE, THE TOPMOST PEAK OF LIVING, AND IT CAME RARELY. THANKS TO THE SCHOOL OF SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHERS HE FAVORED, HE KNEW THE BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF LOVE; BUT BY A REFINED PROCESS OF THE SAME SCIENTIFIC REASONING HE REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT THE HUMAN ORGANISM ACHIEVED ITS HIGHEST PURPOSE IN LOVE, THAT LOVE MUST NOT BE QUESTIONED, BUT MUST BE ACCEPTED AS THE HIGHEST GUERDON OF LIFE. THUS, HE CONSIDERED THE LOVER BLESSED OVER ALL CREATURES, AND IT WAS A DELIGHT TO HIM TO THINK OF GOD’S OWN MAD LOVER, RISING ABOVE THE THINGS OF EARTH, ABOVE WEALTH AND JUDGMENT, PUBLIC OPINION AND APPLAUSE, RISING ABOVE LIFE ITSELF AND DYING ON A KISS.   MUCH OF THIS MARTIN HAD ALREADY REASONED OUT, AND SOME OF IT HE REASONED OUT LATER. IN THE MEANTIME HE WORKED, TAKING NO RECREATION EXCEPT WHEN HE WENT TO SEE RUTH, AND LIVING LIKE A SPARTAN. HE PAID TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF A MONTH RENT FOR THE SMALL ROOM HE GOT FROM HIS PORTUGUESE LANDLADY, MARIA SILVA, A VIRAGO AND A WIDOW, HARD WORKING AND HARSHER TEMPERED, REARING HER LARGE BROOD OF CHILDREN SOMEHOW, AND DROWNING HER SORROW AND FATIGUE AT IRREGULAR INTERVALS IN A GALLON OF THE THIN, SOUR WINE THAT SHE BOUGHT FROM THE CORNER GROCERY AND SALOON FOR FIFTEEN CENTS. FROM DETESTING HER AND HER FOUL TONGUE AT FIRST, MARTIN GREW TO ADMIRE HER AS HE OBSERVED THE BRAVE FIGHT SHE MADE. THERE WERE BUT FOUR ROOMS IN THE LITTLE HOUSE-THREE, WHEN MARTIN’S WAS SUBTRACTED. ONE OF THESE, THE PARLOR, GAY WITH AN INGRAIN CARPET AND DOLOROUS WITH A FUNERAL CARD AND A DEATH-PICTURE OF ONE OF HER NUMEROUS DEPARTED BABES, WAS KEPT STRICTLY FOR COMPANY. THE BLINDS WERE ALWAYS DOWN, AND HER BAREFOOTED TRIBE WAS NEVER PERMITTED TO ENTER THE SACRED PRECINCT SAVE ON STATE OCCASIONS. SHE COOKED, AND ALL ATE, IN THE KITCHEN, WHERE SHE LIKEWISE WASHED, STARCHED, AND IRONED CLOTHES ON ALL DAYS OF THE WEEK EXCEPT SUNDAY; FOR HER INCOME CAME LARGELY FROM TAKING IN WASHING FROM HER MORE PROSPEROUS NEIGHBORS. REMAINED THE BEDROOM, SMALL AS THE ONE OCCUPIED BY MARTIN, INTO WHICH SHE AND HER SEVEN LITTLE ONES CROWDED AND SLEPT. IT WAS AN EVERLASTING MIRACLE TO MARTIN HOW IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED, AND FROM HER SIDE OF THE THIN PARTITION HE HEARD NIGHTLY EVERY DETAIL OF THE GOING TO BED, THE SQUALLS AND SQUABBLES, THE SOFT CHATTERING, AND THE SLEEPY, TWITTERING NOISES AS OF BIRDS. ANOTHER SOURCE OF INCOME TO MARIA WERE HER COWS, TWO OF THEM, WHICH SHE MILKED NIGHT AND MORNING AND WHICH GAINED A SURREPTITIOUS LIVELIHOOD FROM VACANT LOTS AND THE GRASS THAT GREW ON EITHER SIDE THE PUBLIC SIDE WALKS, ATTENDED ALWAYS BY ONE OR MORE OF HER RAGGED BOYS, WHOSE WATCHFUL GUARDIANSHIP CONSISTED CHIEFLY IN KEEPING THEIR EYES OUT FOR THE POUNDMEN.   IN HIS OWN SMALL ROOM MARTIN LIVED, SLEPT, STUDIED, WROTE, AND KEPT HOUSE. BEFORE THE ONE WINDOW, LOOKING OUT ON THE TINY FRONT PORCH, WAS THE KITCHEN TABLE THAT SERVED AS DESK, LIBRARY, AND TYPE-WRITING STAND. THE BED, AGAINST THE REAR WALL, OCCUPIED TWO-THIRDS OF THE TOTAL SPACE OF THE ROOM. THE TABLE WAS FLANKED ON ONE SIDE BY A GAUDY BUREAU, MANUFACTURED FOR PROFIT AND NOT FOR SERVICE, THE THIN VENEER OF WHICH WAS SHED DAY BY DAY. THIS BUREAU STOOD IN THE CORNER, AND IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER, ON THE TABLE’S OTHER FLANK, WAS THE KITCHEN-THE OIL-STOVE ON A DRY-GOODS BOX, INSIDE OF WHICH WERE DISHES AND COOKING UTENSILS, A SHELF ON THE WALL FOR PROVISIONS, AND A BUCKET OF WATER ON THE FLOOR. MARTIN HAD TO CARRY HIS WATER FROM THE KITCHEN SINK, THERE BEING NO TAP IN HIS ROOM. ON DAYS WHEN THERE WAS MUCH STEAM TO HIS COOKING, THE HARVEST OF VENEER FROM THE BUREAU WAS UNUSUALLY GENEROUS. OVER THE BED, HOISTED BY A TACKLE TO THE CEILING, WAS HIS BICYCLE. AT FIRST HE HAD TRIED TO KEEP IT IN THE BASEMENT; BUT THE TRIBE OF SILVA, LOOSENING THE BEARINGS AND PUNCTURING THE TIRES, HAD DRIVEN HIM OUT. NEXT HE ATTEMPTED THE TINY FRONT PORCH, UNTIL A HOWLING SOUTHEASTER DRENCHED THE WHEEL A NIGHT-LONG. THEN HE HAD RETREATED WITH IT TO HIS ROOM AND SLUNG IT ALOFT.   A SMALL CLOSET CONTAINED HIS CLOTHES AND THE BOOKS HE HAD ACCUMULATED AND FOR WHICH THERE WAS NO ROOM ON THE TABLE OR UNDER THE TABLE. HAND IN HAND WITH READING, HE HAD DEVELOPED THE HABIT OF MAKING NOTES, AND SO COPIOUSLY DID HE MAKE THEM THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO EXISTENCE FOR HIM IN THE CONFINED QUARTERS HAD HE NOT RIGGED SEVERAL CLOTHES-LINES ACROSS THE ROOM ON WHICH THE NOTES WERE HUNG. EVEN SO, HE WAS CROWDED UNTIL NAVIGATING THE ROOM WAS A DIFFICULT TASK. HE COULD NOT OPEN THE DOOR WITHOUT FIRST CLOSING THE CLOSET DOOR, AND VICE VERSA . IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM ANYWHERE TO TRAVERSE THE ROOM IN A STRAIGHT LINE. TO GO FROM THE DOOR TO THE HEAD OF THE BED WAS A ZIGZAG COURSE THAT HE WAS NEVER QUITE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE DARK WITHOUT COLLISIONS. HAVING SETTLED THE DIFFICULTY OF THE CONFLICTING DOORS, HE HAD TO STEER SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT TO AVOID THE KITCHEN. NEXT, HE SHEERED TO THE LEFT, TO ESCAPE THE FOOT OF THE BED; BUT THIS SHEER, IF TOO GENEROUS, BROUGHT HIM AGAINST THE CORNER OF THE TABLE. WITH A SUDDEN TWITCH AND LURCH, HE TERMINATED THE SHEER AND BORE OFF TO THE RIGHT ALONG A SORT OF CANAL, ONE BANK OF WHICH WAS THE BED, THE OTHER THE TABLE. WHEN THE ONE CHAIR IN THE ROOM WAS AT ITS USUAL PLACE BEFORE THE TABLE, THE CANAL WAS UNNAVIGABLE. WHEN THE CHAIR WAS NOT IN USE, IT REPOSED ON TOP OF THE BED, THOUGH SOMETIMES HE SAT ON THE CHAIR WHEN COOKING, READING A BOOK WHILE THE WATER BOILED, AND EVEN BECOMING SKILFUL ENOUGH TO MANAGE A PARAGRAPH OR TWO WHILE STEAK WAS FRYING. ALSO, SO SMALL WAS THE LITTLE CORNER THAT CONSTITUTED THE KITCHEN, HE WAS ABLE, SITTING DOWN, TO REACH ANYTHING HE NEEDED. IN FACT, IT WAS EXPEDIENT TO COOK SITTING DOWN; STANDING UP, HE WAS TOO OFTEN IN HIS OWN WAY.   IN CONJUNCTION WITH A PERFECT STOMACH THAT COULD DIGEST ANYTHING, HE POSSESSED KNOWLEDGE OF THE VARIOUS FOODS THAT WERE AT THE SAME TIME NUTRITIOUS AND CHEAP. PEA-SOUP WAS A COMMON ARTICLE IN HIS DIET, AS WELL AS POTATOES AND BEANS, THE LATTER LARGE AND BROWN AND COOKED IN MEXICAN STYLE. RICE, COOKED AS AMERICAN HOUSEWIVES NEVER COOK IT AND CAN NEVER LEARN TO COOK IT, APPEARED ON MARTIN’S TABLE AT LEAST ONCE A DAY. DRIED FRUITS WERE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN FRESH, AND HE HAD USUALLY A POT OF THEM, COOKED AND READY AT HAND, FOR THEY TOOK THE PLACE OF BUTTER ON HIS BREAD. OCCASIONALLY HE GRACED HIS TABLE WITH A PIECE OF ROUND-STEAK, OR WITH A SOUP-BONE. COFFEE, WITHOUT CREAM OR MILK, HE HAD TWICE A DAY, IN THE EVENING SUBSTITUTING TEA; BUT BOTH COFFEE AND TEA WERE EXCELLENTLY COOKED.   THERE WAS NEED FOR HIM TO BE ECONOMICAL. HIS VACATION HAD CONSUMED NEARLY ALL HE HAD EARNED IN THE LAUNDRY, AND HE WAS SO FAR FROM HIS MARKET THAT WEEKS MUST ELAPSE BEFORE HE COULD HOPE FOR THE FIRST RETURNS FROM HIS HACK-WORK. EXCEPT AT SUCH TIMES AS HE SAW RUTH, OR DROPPED IN TO SEE HIS SISTER GERTUDE, HE LIVED A RECLUSE, IN EACH DAY ACCOMPLISHING AT LEAST THREE DAYS’ LABOR OF ORDINARY MEN. HE SLEPT A SCANT FIVE HOURS, AND ONLY ONE WITH A CONSTITUTION OF IRON COULD HAVE HELD HIMSELF DOWN, AS MARTIN DID, DAY AFTER DAY, TO NINETEEN CONSECUTIVE HOURS OF TOIL. HE NEVER LOST A MOMENT. ON THE LOOKING-GLASS WERE LISTS OF DEFINITIONS AND PRONUNCIATIONS; WHEN SHAVING, OR DRESSING, OR COMBING HIS HAIR, HE CONNED THESE LISTS OVER. SIMILAR LISTS WERE ON THE WALL OVER THE OIL-STOVE, AND THEY WERE SIMILARLY CONNED WHILE HE WAS ENGAGED IN COOKING OR IN WASHING THE DISHES. NEW LISTS CONTINUALLY DISPLACED THE OLD ONES. EVERY STRANGE OR PARTLY FAMILIAR WORD ENCOUNTERED IN HIS READING WAS IMMEDIATELY JOTTED DOWN, AND LATER, WHEN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER HAD BEEN ACCUMULATED, WERE TYPED AND PINNED TO THE WALL OR LOOKING-GLASS. HE EVEN CARRIED THEM IN HIS POCKETS, AND REVIEWED THEM AT ODD MOMENTS ON THE STREET, OR WHILE WAITING IN BUTCHER SHOP OR GROCERY TO BE SERVED.   HE WENT FARTHER IN THE MATTER. READING THE WORKS OF MEN WHO HAD ARRIVED, HE NOTED EVERY RESULT ACHIEVED BY THEM, AND WORKED OUT THE TRICKS BY WHICH THEY HAD BEEN ACHIEVED-THE TRICKS OF NARRATIVE, OF EXPOSITION, OF STYLE, THE POINTS OF VIEW, THE CONTRASTS, THE EPIGRAMS; AND OF ALL THESE HE MADE LISTS FOR STUDY. HE DID NOT APE. HE SOUGHT PRINCIPLES. HE DREW UP LISTS OF EFFECTIVE AND FETCHING MANNERISMS, TILL OUT OF MANY SUCH, CULLED FROM MANY WRITERS, HE WAS ABLE TO INDUCE THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF MANNERISM, AND, THUS EQUIPPED, TO CAST ABOUT FOR NEW AND ORIGINAL ONES OF HIS OWN, AND TO WEIGH AND MEASURE AND APPRAISE THEM PROPERLY. IN SIMILAR MANNER HE COLLECTED LISTS OF STRONG PHRASES, THE PHRASES OF LIVING LANGUAGE, PHRASES THAT BIT LIKE ACID AND SCORCHED LIKE FLAME, OR THAT GLOWED AND WERE MELLOW AND LUSCIOUS IN THE MIDST OF THE ARID DESERT OF COMMON SPEECH. HE SOUGHT ALWAYS FOR THE PRINCIPLE THAT LAY BEHIND AND BENEATH. HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW THE THING WAS DONE; AFTER THAT HE COULD DO IT FOR HIMSELF. HE WAS NOT CONTENT WITH THE FAIR FACE OF BEAUTY. HE DISSECTED BEAUTY IN HIS CROWDED LITTLE BEDROOM LABORATORY, WHERE COOKING SMELLS ALTERNATED WITH THE OUTER BEDLAM OF THE SILVA TRIBE; AND, HAVING DISSECTED AND LEARNED THE ANATOMY OF BEAUTY, HE WAS NEARER BEING ABLE TO CREATE BEAUTY ITSELF.   HE WAS SO MADE THAT HE COULD WORK ONLY WITH UNDERSTANDING. HE COULD NOT WORK BLINDLY, IN THE DARK, IGNORANT OF WHAT HE WAS PRODUCING AND TRUSTING TO CHANCE AND THE STAR OF HIS GENIUS THAT THE EFFECT PRODUCED SHOULD BE RIGHT AND FINE. HE HAD NO PATIENCE WITH CHANCE EFFECTS. HE WANTED TO KNOW WHY AND HOW. HIS WAS DELIBERATE CREATIVE GENIUS, AND, BEFORE HE BEGAN A STORY OR POEM, THE THING ITSELF WAS ALREADY ALIVE IN HIS BRAIN, WITH THE END IN SIGHT AND THE MEANS OF REALIZING THAT END IN HIS CONSCIOUS POSSESSION. OTHERWISE THE EFFORT WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE. ON THE OTHER HAND, HE APPRECIATED THE CHANCE EFFECTS IN WORDS AND PHRASES THAT CAME LIGHTLY AND EASILY INTO HIS BRAIN, AND THAT LATER STOOD ALL TESTS OF BEAUTY AND POWER AND DEVELOPED TREMENDOUS AND INCOMMUNICABLE CONNOTATIONS. BEFORE SUCH HE BOWED DOWN AND MARVELLED, KNOWING THAT THEY WERE BEYOND THE DELIBERATE CREATION OF ANY MAN. AND NO MATTER HOW MUCH HE DISSECTED BEAUTY IN SEARCH OF THE PRINCIPLES THAT UNDERLIE BEAUTY AND MAKE BEAUTY POSSIBLE, HE WAS AWARE, ALWAYS, OF THE INNERMOST MYSTERY OF BEAUTY TO WHICH HE DID NOT PENETRATE AND TO WHICH NO MAN HAD EVER PENETRATED. HE KNEW FULL WELL, FROM HIS SPENCER, THAT MAN CAN NEVER ATTAIN ULTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF ANYTHING, AND THAT THE MYSTERY OF BEAUTY WAS NO LESS THAN THAT OF LIFE-NAY, MORE THAT THE FIBRES OF BEAUTY AND LIFE WERE INTERTWISTED, AND THAT HE HIMSELF WAS BUT A BIT OF THE SAME NONUNDERSTANDABLE FABRIC, TWISTED OF SUNSHINE AND STAR-DUST AND WONDER.   IN FACT, IT WAS WHEN FILLED WITH THESE THOUGHTS THAT HE WROTE HIS ESSAY ENTITLED STAR-DUST, IN WHICH HE HAD HIS FLING, NOT AT THE PRINCIPLES OF CRITICISM, BUT AT THE PRINCIPAL CRITICS. IT WAS BRILLIANT, DEEP, PHILOSOPHICAL, AND DELICIOUSLY TOUCHED WITH LAUGHTER. ALSO IT WAS PROMPTLY REJECTED BY THE MAGAZINES AS OFTEN AS IT WAS SUBMITTED. BUT HAVING CLEARED HIS MIND OF IT, HE WENT SERENELY ON HIS WAY. IT WAS A HABIT HE DEVELOPED, OF INCUBATING AND MATURING HIS THOUGHT UPON A SUBJECT, AND OF THEN RUSHING INTO THE TYPE-WRITER WITH IT. THAT IT DID NOT SEE PRINT WAS A MATTER A SMALL MOMENT WITH HIM. THE WRITING OF IT WAS THE CULMINATING ACT OF A LONG MENTAL PROCESS, THE DRAWING TOGETHER OF SCATTERED THREADS OF THOUGHT AND THE FINAL GENERALIZING UPON ALL THE DATA WITH WHICH HIS MIND WAS BURDENED. TO WRITE SUCH AN ARTICLE WAS THE CONSCIOUS EFFORT BY WHICH HE FREED HIS MIND AND MADE IT READY FOR FRESH MATERIAL AND PROBLEMS. IT WAS IN A WAY AKIN TO THAT COMMON HABIT OF MEN AND WOMEN TROUBLED BY REAL OR FANCIED GRIEVANCES, WHO PERIODICALLY AND VOLUBLY BREAK THEIR LONG-SUFFERING SILENCE AND HAVE THEIR SAY TILL THE LAST WORD IS SAID."

ПООДАЛЬ  В ЛЕСУ БЫЛО МРАЧНОВАТО ОТ ТЕМНОЙ МЕШАНИНЫ ЕЛЕЙ, ПОДЛЕСКА,  КАКИХ-ТО  НЕЯСНЫХ ТЕНЕЙ, БЕСПОРЯДОЧНОГО  СПЛЕТЕНИЯ  СТЫЛЫХ  ВЕТВЕЙ;  ВБЛИЗИ  ЖЕ,  НА  ЧИСТОЙ БЕЛИЗНЕ СНЕГА, ДОРОГА ПРОСМАТРИВАЛАСЬ БЕЗ ТРУДА.

НО ВСЕ ЖЕ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ БЫТЬ НАСТОРОЖЕ, ОСОБЕННО  ПОСЛЕ  ГЛИНЯН, ВОЗЛЕ КОТОРЫХ ОНИ ЧАСА ДВА НАЗАД ЕДВА НЕ НАПОРОЛИСЬ НА НЕМЦЕВ. К  СЧАСТЬЮ, НА ОКОЛИЦЕ ДЕРЕВНИ  ПОВСТРЕЧАЛСЯ  ДЯДЬКА  С  ДРОВАМИ,  ОН  ПРЕДУПРЕДИЛ  ОБ ОПАСНОСТИ, И ОНИ ПОВЕРНУЛИ В ЛЕС, ГДЕ ДОЛГО ПРОПЛУТАЛИ В ЗАРОСЛЯХ, ПОКА НЕ ВЫБРАЛИСЬ НА ЭТУ ДОРОГУ.    ВПРОЧЕМ, СЛУЧАЙНАЯ СТЫЧКА В ЛЕСУ ИЛИ В ПОЛЕ НЕ ОЧЕНЬ СТРАШИЛА РЫБАКА: У НИХ БЫЛО ОРУЖИЕ. ПРАВДА, МАЛОВАТО НАБРАЛОСЬ ПАТРОНОВ,  НО  ТУТ  НИЧЕГО  НЕ ПОДЕЛАЕШЬ: ТЕ, ЧТО ОСТАЛИСЬ НА ГОРЕЛОМ БОЛОТЕ,  ОТДАЛИ  ИМ  ЧТО  МОГЛИ  ИЗ СВОИХ ТОЖЕ БОЛЕЕ ЧЕМ СКУДНЫХ ЗАПАСОВ. ТЕПЕРЬ, КРОМЕ ПЯТИ ШТУК В  КАРАБИНЕ, У РЫБАКА ПОЗВЯКИВАЛИ ЕЩЕ ТРИ ОБОЙМЫ В КАРМАНАХ ПОЛУШУБКА, СТОЛЬКО ЖЕ  БЫЛО И У СОТНИКОВА. ЖАЛЬ, НЕ ПРИХВАТИЛИ ГРАНАТ, НО, МОЖЕТ,  ГРАНАТЫ  ЕЩЕ  И  НЕ ПОНАДОБЯТСЯ, А К УТРУ ОБА ОНИ БУДУТ В  ЛАГЕРЕ.  ПО  КРАЙНЕЙ  МЕРЕ,  ДОЛЖНЫ БЫТЬ. ПРАВДА, РЫБАК ЧУВСТВОВАЛ, ЧТО ПОСЛЕ НЕУДАЧИ В ГЛИНЯНАХ  ОНИ  НЕМНОГО ЗАПАЗДЫВАЮТ, НАДО БЫЛО ПОТОРАПЛИВАТЬСЯ, НО ПОДВОДИЛ НАПАРНИК.    ВСЕ ВРЕМЯ, ПОКА ОНИ ШЛИ ЛЕСОМ, РЫБАК СЛЫШАЛ ЗА СПИНОЙ  ЕГО  ГЛУХОВАТЫЙ, ПРОСТУДНЫЙ КАШЕЛЬ, РАЗДАВАВШИЙСЯ ИНОГДА БЛИЖЕ, ИНОГДА ДАЛЬШЕ.  НО  ВОТ  ОН СОВЕРШЕННО ЗАТИХ,  И  РЫБАК,  СБАВИВ  ШАГ,  ОГЛЯНУЛСЯ  -  ИЗРЯДНО  ОТСТАВ, СОТНИКОВ ЕДВА ТАЩИЛСЯ В НОЧНОМ СУМРАКЕ. ПОДАВЛЯЯ НЕТЕРПЕНИЕ, РЫБАК  МИНУТУ ГЛЯДЕЛ, КАК ТОТ УСТАЛО ГРЕБЕТСЯ ПО СНЕГУ  В  СВОИХ  НЕУКЛЮЖИХ,  СТОПТАННЫХ БУРКАХ, КАК-ТО НЕЗНАКОМО  ОПУСТИВ  ГОЛОВУ  В  ГЛУБОКО  НАДВИНУТОЙ  НА  УШИ КРАСНОАРМЕЙСКОЙ ПИЛОТКЕ. ЕЩЕ ИЗДАЛИ В МОРОЗНОЙ НОЧНОЙ  ТИШИНЕ  ПОСЛЫШАЛОСЬ ЕГО ЧАСТОЕ, ЗАТРУДНЕННОЕ ДЫХАНИЕ, С КОТОРЫМ СОТНИКОВ, ДАЖЕ  ОСТАНОВИВШИСЬ, ВСЕ ЕЩЕ НЕ МОГ СПРАВИТЬСЯ.    - НУ КАК? ТЕРПИМО?    - А! - НЕОПРЕДЕЛЕННО ВЫДАВИЛ ТОТ И ПОПРАВИЛ НА ПЛЕЧЕ ВИНТОВКУ. - ДАЛЕКО ЕЩЕ?    ПРЕЖДЕ ЧЕМ ОТВЕТИТЬ, РЫБАК ПОМЕДЛИЛ,  ИСПЫТУЮЩЕ  ВГЛЯДЫВАЯСЬ  В  ТОЩУЮ, ТУГО ПОДПОЯСАННУЮ ПО КОРОТКОЙ ШИНЕЛИ ФИГУРУ НАПАРНИКА. ОН  УЖЕ  ЗНАЛ,  ЧТО ТОТ НЕ ПРИЗНАЕТСЯ, ХОТЯ И ЗАНЕМОГ,  БУДЕТ  БОДРИТЬСЯ:  МОЛ,  ОБОЙДЕТСЯ,  - ЧТОБЫ ИЗБЕЖАТЬ ЧУЖОГО УЧАСТИЯ, ЧТО ЛИ? УЖ  ЧЕГО  ДРУГОГО,  А  САМОЛЮБИЯ  И УПРЯМСТВА У ЭТОГО СОТНИКОВА ХВАТИЛО БЫ НА ТРОИХ. ОН  И  НА  ЗАДАНИЕ  ПОПАЛ ОТЧАСТИ ИЗ-ЗА СВОЕГО САМОЛЮБИЯ - БОЛЬНОЙ, А НЕ  ЗАХОТЕЛ  СКАЗАТЬ  ОБ  ЭТОМ КОМАНДИРУ, КОГДА ТОТ У КОСТРА  ПОДБИРАЛ  РЫБАКУ  НАПАРНИКА.  СНАЧАЛА  БЫЛИ ВЫЗВАНЫ ДВОЕ - ВДОВЕЦ И ГЛУЩЕНКО, НО ВДОВЕЦ ТОЛЬКО ЧТО РАЗОБРАЛ И ПРИНЯЛСЯ ЧИСТИТЬ СВОЙ ПУЛЕМЕТ, А ГЛУЩЕНКО СОСЛАЛСЯ НА МОКРЫЕ НОГИ: ХОДИЛ ЗА ВОДОЙ И ПО КОЛЕНО ПРОВАЛИЛСЯ В ТРЯСИНУ. ТОГДА КОМАНДИР  НАЗВАЛ  СОТНИКОВА,  И  ТОТ МОЛЧА ПОДНЯЛСЯ. КОГДА ОНИ УЖЕ БЫЛИ  В  ПУТИ  И  СОТНИКОВА  НАЧАЛ  ДОНИМАТЬ КАШЕЛЬ,  РЫБАК  СПРОСИЛ,  ПОЧЕМУ  ОН  СМОЛЧАЛ,  ТОГДА  КАК   ДВОЕ   ДРУГИХ ОТКАЗАЛИСЬ, НА ЧТО СОТНИКОВ ОТВЕТИЛ:  ПОТОМУ И НЕ  ОТКАЗАЛСЯ,  ЧТО  ДРУГИЕ ОТКАЗАЛИСЬ . РЫБАКУ ЭТО БЫЛО НЕ СОВСЕМ ПОНЯТНО, НО ПОГОДЯ ОН ПОДУМАЛ,  ЧТО В ОБЩЕМ БЕСПОКОИТЬСЯ НЕ О ЧЕМ: ЧЕЛОВЕК НА НОГАХ, СЮИТ ЛИ ОБРАЩАТЬ ВНИМАНИЕ НА КАКОЙ-ТО ТАМ КАШЕЛЬ, ОТ ПРОСТУДЫ НА ВОЙНЕ НЕ УМИРАЮТ. ДОЙДЕТ ДО  ЖИЛЬЯ, ОБОГРЕЕТСЯ, ПОЕСТ ГОРЯЧЕЙ КАРТОШКИ, И ВСЮ ХВОРЬ КАК РУКОЙ СНИМЕТ.    - НИЧЕГО, ТЕПЕРЬ УЖЕ БЛИЗКО, - ОБОДРЯЮЩЕ  СКАЗАЛ  РЫБАК  И  ПОВЕРНУЛСЯ, ЧТОБЫ ПРОДОЛЖИТЬ ПУТЬ.    НО НЕ УСПЕЛ СДЕЛАТЬ И ШАГА, КАК  СОТНИКОВ  СЗАДИ  ОПЯТЬ  ПОПЕРХНУЛСЯ  И ЗАШЕЛСЯ В ДОЛГОМ НУТРЯНОМ  КАШЛЕ.  СТАРАЯСЬ  СДЕРЖАТЬСЯ,  СОГНУЛСЯ,  ЗАЖАЛ РУКАВОМ РОТ, НО КАШЕЛЬ ОТТОГО ТОЛЬКО УСИЛИЛСЯ.    - А ТЫ СНЕГА! СНЕГА ВОЗЬМИ, ОН ПЕРЕБИВАЕТ! - ПОДСКАЗАЛ РЫБАК.    БОРЯСЬ  С  ПРИСТУПОМ  РАЗДИРАЮЩЕГО  ГРУДЬ  КАШЛЯ,  СОТНИКОВ   ЗАЧЕРПНУЛ ПРИГОРШНЕЙ СНЕГА, ПОСОСАЛ, И КАШЕЛЬ В САМОМ ДЕЛЕ ПОНЕМНОГУ УНЯЛСЯ.    - ЧЕРТ! ПРИВЯЖЕТСЯ, ХОТЬ РАЗОРВИСЬ!    РЫБАК ВПЕРВЫЕ ОЗАБОЧЕННО НАХМУРИЛСЯ, НО ПРОМОЛЧАЛ, И ОНИ ПОШЛИ ДАЛЬШЕ.    ИЗ ОВРАГА НА ДОРОГУ ВЫБЕЖАЛА  РОВНАЯ  ЦЕПОЧКА  СЛЕДА,  ПРИГЛЯДЕВШИСЬ  К КОТОРОМУ РЫБАК ПОНЯЛ, ЧТО НЕДАВНО  ЗДЕСЬ  ПРОХОДИЛ  ВОЛК  (ТОЖЕ,  НАВЕРНО, ТЯНЕТ К ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСКОМУ ЖИЛЬЮ - НЕ СЛАДКО НА ТАКОМ МОРОЗЕ В ЛЕСУ).  ОБА  ОНИ ВЗЯЛИ НЕСКОЛЬКО В СТОРОНУ И ДАЛЬШЕ УЖЕ НЕ СХОДИЛИ С ЭТОГО СЛЕДА, КОТОРЫЙ В ПРИТУМАНЕННОЙ СЕРОСТИ НОЧИ НЕ ТОЛЬКО ОБОЗНАЧАЛ ДОРОГУ, НО И УКАЗЫВАЛ,  ГДЕ МЕНЬШЕ СНЕГА: ВОЛК ЭТО ОПРЕДЕЛЯЛ БЕЗОШИБОЧНО. ВПРОЧЕМ, ИХ ПУТЬ ПОДХОДИЛ  К КОНЦУ, ВОТ-ВОТ ДОЛЖЕН БЫЛ ПОКАЗАТЬСЯ ХУТОР, И ЭТО  НАСТРАИВАЛО  РЫБАКА  НА НОВЫЙ, БОЛЕЕ РАДОСТНЫЙ ЛАД.    - ЛЮБКА ТАМ, ВОТ ОГОНЬ ДЕВКА! - НЕГРОМКО СКАЗАЛ ОН, НЕ ОБОРАЧИВАЯСЬ.    - ЧТО? - НЕ РАССЛЫШАЛ СОТНИКОВ.    - ДЕВКА, ГОВОРЮ, НА ХУТОРЕ. УВИДИШЬ, ВСЮ ХВОРЬ ЗАБУДЕШЬ.    - У ТЕБЯ ЕЩЕ ДЕВКИ НА УМЕ?    С ЗАМЕТНЫМ УСИЛИЕМ ВОЛОЧАСЬ СЗАДИ, СОТНИКОВ УРОНИЛ ГОЛОВУ И ЕЩЕ  БОЛЬШЕ ССУТУЛИЛСЯ. ПО-ВИДИМОМУ, ВСЕ ЕГО ВНИМАНИЕ ТЕПЕРЬ БЫЛО  СОСРЕДОТОЧЕНО  ЛИШЬ НА ТОМ, ЧТОБЫ НЕ СБИТЬСЯ С ШАГА, НЕ ПОТЕРЯТЬ ПОСИЛЬНЫЙ ЕМУ ТЕМП.    - А ЧТО Ж! ПОЕСТЬ БЫ ТОЛЬКО...    НО И УПОМИНАНИЕ О ЕДЕ НИКАК  НЕ  ПОДЕЙСТВОВАЛО  НА  СОТНИКОВА,  КОТОРЫЙ ОПЯТЬ НАЧАЛ ОТСТАВАТЬ, И РЫБАК, ЗАМЕДЛИВ ШАГ, ОГЛЯНУЛСЯ.    - ЗНАЕШЬ, ВЧЕРА ВЗДРЕМНУЛ НА БОЛОТЕ - ХЛЕБ ПРИСНИЛСЯ. ТЕПЛАЯ БУХАНКА ЗА ПАЗУХОЙ. ПРОСНУЛСЯ, А ЭТО ОТ КОСТРА ПРИГРЕЛО. ТАКАЯ ДОСАДА...    - НЕ ДИВО, ПРИСНИТСЯ, - ГЛУХО СОГЛАСИЛСЯ СОТНИКОВ. - НЕДЕЛЮ НА  ПАРЕНОЙ РЖИ...    - ДА УЖ И ПАРЕНКА КОНЧИЛАСЬ. ВЧЕРА ГРОНСКИЙ ОСТАТКИ  РОЗДАЛ,  -  СКАЗАЛ РЫБАК И ЗАМОЛЧАЛ, СТАРАЯСЬ НЕ ЗАВОДИТЬ РАЗГОВОРА О ТОМ,  ЧТО  В  ЭТОТ  РАЗ ДЕЙСТВИТЕЛЬНО ЗАНИМАЛО ЕГО.    К ТОМУ ЖЕ СТАНОВИЛОСЬ НЕ ДО РАЗГОВОРОВ: КОНЧАЛСЯ ЛЕС, ДОРОГА ВЫХОДИЛА В ПОЛЕ. ДАЛЕЕ ПО ОДНУ СТОРОНУ ПУТИ ТЯНУЛСЯ МЕЛКИЙ КУСТАРНИК, ЗАРОСЛИ ЛОЗНЯКА ПО БОЛОТУ, ДОРОГА ОТ КОТОРОГО КРУТО СВОРАЧИВАЛА НА ПРИГОРОК.  РЫБАК  ЖДАЛ, ЧТО ИЗ-ЗА ОЛЬШАНИКА ВОТ-ВОТ ПОКАЖЕТСЯ ДЫРЯВАЯ  КРЫША  ПУНЬКИ,  А  ТАМ,  ЗА ИЗГОРОДЬЮ БУДЕТ И ДОМ С САРАЯМИ И ЗАДРАННЫМ ЖУРАВЛЕМ  НАД  КОЛОДЦЕМ.  ЕСЛИ ЖУРАВЛЬ ТОРЧИТ КОНЦОМ ВВЕРХ - ЗНАЧИТ, ВСЕ В ПОРЯДКЕ, МОЖНО ЗАХОДИТЬ;  ЕСЛИ ЖЕ ЗАЦЕПЛЕН КРЮКОМ В КОЛОДЕЗНОМ СРУБЕ, ТО ПОВОРАЧИВАЙ  ОБРАТНО  -  В  ДОМЕ ЧУЖИЕ. ТАК, ПО  КРАЙНЕЙ  МЕРЕ,  КОГДА-ТО  УСЛОВИЛИСЬ  С  ДЯДЬКОЙ  РОМАНОМ. ПРАВДА, ТО БЫЛО ДАВНО, С ОСЕНИ ОНИ СЮДА НЕ ЗАГЛЯДЫВАЛИ - КРУЖИЛИ В  ДРУГИХ МЕСТАХ, ПО ТУ СТОРОНУ ШОССЕ, ПОКА ГОЛОД И ЖАНДАРМЫ  ОПЯТЬ  НЕ  ЗАГНАЛИ  ИХ ТУДА, ОТКУДА МЕСЯЦ НАЗАД ВЫГНАЛИ.    СКОРЫМ ШАГОМ РЫБАК ДОШЕЛ ДО ИЗГИБА ДОРОГИ И СВЕРНУЛ НА ПРИГОРОК. ВОЛЧИЙ СЛЕД НА СНЕГУ  ТАКЖЕ  ПОВОРАЧИВАЛ  В  СТОРОНУ  ХУТОРА.  ОЧЕВИДНО  ЧУВСТВУЯ БЛИЗОСТЬ  ЖИЛЬЯ,  ВОЛК  ОСТОРОЖНО  И  НЕШИРОКО  СТУПАЛ   ОБОЧИНОЙ,   ТЕСНО ПРИЖИМАЯСЬ К КУСТАРНИКУ. ВПРОЧЕМ, РЫБАК УЖЕ ПЕРЕСТАЛ СЛЕДИТЬ ЗА ДОРОГОЙ  - ВСЕ ЕГО  ВНИМАНИЕ  ТЕПЕРЬ  БЫЛО  УСТРЕМЛЕНО  ВПЕРЕД,  ТУДА,  ГДЕ  КОНЧАЛСЯ КУСТАРНИК.    НАКОНЕЦ ОН ТОРОПЛИВО ВЗОБРАЛСЯ ПО СКЛОНУ НА  ВЕРХ  ПРИГОРКА  И  ТУТ  ЖЕ ПОДУМАЛ, ЧТО, ПО-ВИДИМОМУ, ОШИБСЯ  -  НАВЕРНО,  ХУТОРСКИЕ  ПОСТРОЙКИ  БЫЛИ НЕСКОЛЬКО ДАЛЬШЕ.  ТАК  НЕРЕДКО  СЛУЧАЕТСЯ  НА  МАЛОЗНАКОМОЙ  ДОРОГЕ,  ЧТО НЕКОТОРЫЕ УЧАСТКИ ЕЕ ИСЧЕЗАЮТ ИЗ ПАМЯТИ, И ТОГДА ВЕСЬ ПУТЬ СДАЕТСЯ КОРОЧЕ, ЧЕМ НА САМОМ ДЕЛЕ. РЫБАК ЕЩЕ УСКОРИЛ СВОЙ ШАГ, НО  ОПЯТЬ  НАЧАЛ  ОТСТАВАТЬ СОТНИКОВ. ВПРОЧЕМ, НА СОТНИКОВА РЫБАК УЖЕ  ПЕРЕСТАЛ  ОБРАЩАТЬ  ВНИМАНИЕ  - НЕОЖИДАННО И КАК БУДТО БЕЗ ВСЯКОЙ ПРИЧИНЫ ИМ ЗАВЛАДЕЛА ТРЕВОГА.    ПУНЬКИ ВСЕ ЕЩЕ НЕ БЫЛО В НОЧНОЙ СЕРОСТИ, КАК НЕ БЫЛО ВПЕРЕДИ  И  ДРУГИХ ПОСТРОЕК,  ЗАТО  НЕСКОЛЬКО  ПОРЫВОВ  ВЕТРА  ОТТУДА  ДОНЕСЛИ  ДО   ПУТНИКОВ ГОРЬКОВАТО-ЕДКИЙ  СМРАД  ГАРИ.  РЫБАК  СНАЧАЛА  ПОДУМАЛ,   ЧТО   ЭТО   ЕМУ ПОКАЗАЛОСЬ, ЧТО НЕСЕТ ОТКУДА-ТО ИЗ ЛЕСА. ОН ПРОШЕЛ ЕЩЕ СОТНЮ ШАГОВ, СИЛЯСЬ УВИДЕТЬ СКВОЗЬ ЗАРОСЛИ  ПРИВЫЧНО  ОСНЕЖЕННЫЕ  КРЫШИ  УСАДЬБЫ.  ОДНАКО  ЕГО ОЖИДАНИЕ НЕ СБЫЛОСЬ - ХУТОРА НЕ БЫЛО. ЗАТО ЕЩЕ ПОТЯНУЛО ГАРЬЮ - НЕ СВЕЖЕЙ, С ОГНЕМ ИЛИ ДЫМОМ, А ПРОТИВНЫМ СМРАДОМ  ДАВНО,  ОСТЫВШИХ  УГЛЕЙ  И  ПЕПЛА. ПОНЯВ,  ЧТО  НЕ  ОШИБАЕТСЯ,  РЫБАК  ВПОЛГОЛОСА  ВЫРУГАЛСЯ  И  ПОЧТИ  БЕГОМ ПРИПУСТИЛ СЕРЕДИНОЙ ДОРОГИ, ПОКА НЕ НАТКНУЛСЯ НА ИЗГОРОДЬ.    ИЗГОРОДЬ БЫЛА НА МЕСТЕ - НЕСКОЛЬКО  ДАР  ПЕРЕВЯЗАННЫХ  ЛОЗОЙ  КОЛЬЕВ  С ЖЕРДЯМИ КРИВО ТОРЧАЛИ В СНЕГУ. ТУТ, ЗА  ПОЛОСКОЙ  КАРТОФЛЯНИЩА,  И  СТОЯЛА КОГДА-ТО ТА  САМАЯ  ПУНЬКА,  НА  МЕСТЕ  КОТОРОЙ  СЕЙЧАС  ВОЗВЫШАЛСЯ  БЕЛЫЙ СНЕГОВОЙ  ХОЛМИК.  МЕСТАМИ  ТАМ  ВЫПИРАЛО,  БУГРИЛОСЬ  ЧТО-ТО   ТЕМНОЕ   - НЕДОГОРЕВШИЕ ГОЛОВЕШКИ, ЧТО ЛЯ? НЕМНОГО В ОТДАЛЕНИИ, У  МОЛОДОЙ  ЯБЛОНЕВОЙ ПОСАДКИ, ГДЕ БЫЛИ ПОСТРОЙКИ, ТОЖЕ ГРОМОЗДИЛИСЬ ЗАНЕСЕННЫЕ СНЕГОМ  БУГРЫ  С ПОЛУРАЗРУШЕННОЙ, НЕЛЕПО ОГОЛЕННОЙ ПЕЧЬЮ ПОСЕРЕДИНЕ. НА МЕСТАХ ЖЕ САРАЕВ  - НЕ ПОНЯТЬ БЫЛО - НАВЕРНО, НЕ ОСТАЛОСЬ И ГОЛОВЕШЕК.    МИНУТУ  РЫБАК  СТОЯЛ  ВОЗЛЕ  ИЗГОРОДИ  ВСЕ  С   ТЕМ   ЖЕ   НЕУМОЛКАВШИМ РУГАТЕЛЬСТВОМ В ДУШЕ, НЕ СРАЗУ СООБРАЗИВ, ЧТО ЗДЕСЬ СЛУЧИЛОСЬ.  ПЕРЕД  ЕГО ГЛАЗАМИ  ВОЗНИКЛА  КАРТИНА  НЕДАВНЕГО  ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСКОГО  ЖИЛЬЯ  С  НЕМУДРЕНЫМ КРЕСТЬЯНСКИМ  УЮТОМ:  ХАТОЙ,  СЕНЯМИ,  БОЛЬШОЙ  ЗАКОПЧЕННОЙ  ПЕЧЬЮ,  ВОЗЛЕ КОТОРОЙ ХЛОПОТАЛА БАБКА МЕЛАНЬЯ - ПЕКЛА ДРАНИКИ. ПЛОТНО ЗАКУСИВ С  ДОРОГИ, ОНИ СИДЕЛИ ТОГДА БЕЗ САПОГ НА ЛЕЖАНКЕ И СМЕШИЛИ ХОХОТУНЬЮ ЛЮБКУ, УГОЩАВШУЮ ИХ ЛЕСНЫМИ ОРЕХАМИ. ТЕПЕРЬ ПЕРЕД НИМ БЫЛО ПОЖАРИЩЕ.    - СВОЛОЧИ!    ПРЕОДОЛЕВ МИНУТНОЕ ОЦЕПЕНЕНИЕ, РЫБАК ПЕРЕШАГНУЛ ЖЕРДЬ И ПОДОШЕЛ К ПЕЧИ, УКРЫТОЙ ШАПКОЙ СВЕЖЕГО СНЕГА. СОВЕРШЕННО  НЕЛЕПЫМ  ВЫГЛЯДЕЛ  НА  НЕЙ  ЭТОТ СНЕГ, ПЛОТНЫМ ПЛАСТОМ ЛЕЖАВШИЙ НА ЗАГНЕТКЕ И ДАЖЕ ЗАПЕЧАТАВШИЙ УСТЬЕ ПЕЧИ. ТРУБЫ НАВЕРХУ УЖЕ НЕ БЫЛО, НАВЕРНО, ОБВАЛИЛАСЬ ВО ВРЕМЯ  ПОЖАРА  И  СЕЙЧАС ВМЕСТЕ С ГОЛОВЕШКАМИ НЕРОВНОЙ КУЧЕЙ БУГРИЛАСЬ ПОД СНЕГОМ.    СЗАДИ ТЕМ ВРЕМЕНЕМ ПРИТАЩИЛСЯ СОТНИКОВ, КОТОРЫЙ МОЛЧА ПОСТОЯЛ НЕМНОГО У ИЗГОРОДИ И ПО ЧИСТОМУ СНЕГУ ПОДВОРЬЯ ОТОШЕЛ К КОЛОДЕЗНОМУ СРУБУ.  КОЛОДЕЦ, КАЖЕТСЯ, БЫЛ ТУТ ЕДИНСТВЕННЫМ, ЧТО НЕ ПОСТРАДАЛО В НЕДАВНЕМ РАЗГРОМЕ.  ЦЕЛ ОКАЗАЛСЯ И  ЖУРАВЛЬ.  ВЫСОКО  ЗАДРАННЫЙ  ЕГО  КРЮК  ТИХО  РАСКАЧИВАЛСЯ  НА ХОЛОДНОМ ВЕТРУ. РЫБАК В СЕРДЦАХ ПНУЛ САПОГОМ ПУСТОЕ ДЫРЯВОЕ ВЕДРО,  ОБОШЕЛ РАЗЛОМАННЫЙ, БЕЗ КОЛЕС, ЯЩИК  ПОЛУЗАМЕТЕННОЙ  СНЕГОМ  ТЕЛЕГИ.  БОЛЬШЕ  ТУТ НЕЧЕМ БЫЛО ПОЖИВИТЬСЯ - ТО, ЧТО НЕ СОЖРАЛ ОГОНЬ, НАВЕРНО, ДАВНО  РАСТАЩИЛИ ЛЮДИ. УСАДЬБА СГОРЕЛА, И НИКОГО НА НЕЙ УЖЕ НЕ БЫЛО.  ДАЖЕ  НЕ  СОХРАНИЛОСЬ ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСКИХ СЛЕДОВ, ЛИШЬ ВОЛЧЬИ ПЕТЛЯЛИ ЗА ИЗГОРОДЬЮ - НАВЕРНО, ВОЛК ТОЖЕ ИМЕЛ КАКИЕ-ТО СВОИ ВИДЫ НА ЭТОТ ЗЛОСЧАСТНЫЙ ХУТОР.    - ПОДРУБАЛИ НАЗЫВАЕТСЯ! - БРОСИЛ РЫБАК, УНЫЛО ВОЗВРАЩАЯСЬ К КОЛОДЦУ.    - ВЫДАЛ КТО-ТО, - СИПЛО ОТОЗВАЛСЯ СОТНИКОВ.    БОКОМ ПРИСЛОНИВШИСЬ - К СРУБУ, ОН ЗАМЕТНО ПОЕЖИВАЛСЯ ОТ СТУЖИ, И, КОГДА ПЕРЕСТАВАЛ КАШЛЯТЬ, СЛЫШНО БЫЛО, КАК В  ЕГО  ГРУДИ  ТИХОНЬКО  ПОХРИПЫВАЛО, СЛОВНО В НЕИСПРАВНОЙ ГАРМОНИ. РЫБАК, ЗАПУСТИВ В КАРМАН  РУКУ,  СОБРАЛ  ТАМ МЕЖДУ ПАТРОНОВ ГОРСТЬ ПАРЕНОЙ РЖИ - ОСТАТОК ЕГО СЕГОДНЯШНЕЙ НОРМЫ.    - ХОЧЕШЬ?    БЕЗ ОСОБОЙ ГОТОВНОСТИ СОТНИКОВ ПРОТЯНУЛ РУКУ, В КОТОРУЮ  РЫБАК  ОТСЫПАЛ ИЗ СВОЕЙ ГОРСТИ. ОБА ПРИНЯЛИСЬ МОЛЧА ЖЕВАТЬ МЯГКИЕ ХОЛОДНЫЕ ЗЕРНА.    ПОЖАЛУЙ, ИМ НАЧИНАЛО  ВСЕРЬЕЗ  НЕ  ВЕЗТИ,  И  РЫБАК  ПОДУМАЛ,  ЧТО  ЭТО НЕВЕЗЕНИЕ ПЕРЕСТАЕТ БЫТЬ СЛУЧАЙНОСТЬЮ: КАЖЕТСЯ, НЕМЦЫ ЗАЖИМАЛИ  ОТРЯД  КАК СЛЕДУЕТ. И НЕ ТАК ВАЖНО БЫЛО, ЧТО ВДВОЕМ ОНИ ОСТАЛИСЬ ГОЛОДНЫМИ, -  БОЛЬШЕ ТРЕВОЖИЛА МЫСЛЬ О ТЕХ, КОТОРЫЕ МЕРЗЛИ ТЕПЕРЬ НА БОЛОТЕ. ЗА НЕДЕЛЮ  БОЕВ  И БЕГОТНИ ПО ЛЕСАМ ЛЮДИ ИЗМОТАЛИСЬ, ОТОЩАЛИ НА ОДНОЙ КАРТОШКЕ, БЕЗ ХЛЕБА,  К ТОМУ ЖЕ ЧЕТВЕРО БЫЛО РАНЕНО, ДВОИХ  НЕСЛИ  С  СОБОЙ  НА  НОСИЛКАХ.  А  ТУТ ПОЛИЦАИ И ЖАНДАРМЕРИЯ ОБЛОЖИЛИ ТАК, ЧТО,  ПОЖАЛУЙ,  НИГДЕ  НЕ  ВЫСУНУТЬСЯ. ПОКА ПРОБИРАЛИСЬ ЛЕСОМ, РЫБАК ДУМАЛ, ЧТО, МОЖЕТ, ЭТА СТОРОНА БОЛОТА ЕЩЕ НЕ ЗАКРЫТА И УДАСТСЯ ПРОЙТИ В ДЕРЕВНЮ, НА ХУДОЙ КОНЕЦ ТУТ БЫЛ ХУТОР.  НО  ВОТ НАДЕЖДА НА ХУТОР РУХНУЛА, А ДАЛЬШЕ, В ТРЕХ КИЛОМЕТРАХ,  БЫЛО  МЕСТЕЧКО,  В НЕМ ПОЛИЦЕЙСКИЙ ГАРНИЗОН, А ВОКРУГ ПОЛЯ И БЕЗЛЕСЬЕ - ТУДА ПУТЬ ИМ ЗАКАЗАН.    ДОЖЕВЫВАЯ РОЖЬ, РЫБАК ОЗАБОЧЕННО ПОВЕРНУЛСЯ К СОТНИКОВУ.    - НУ ТЫ КАК? ЕСЛИ ПЛОХ,  ТОПАЙ  НАЗАД.  А  Я,  МОЖЕТ,  КУДА  В  ДЕРЕВНЮ ПОДСКОЧУ.    - ОДИН?    - ОДИН, А ЧТО? НЕ ВОЗВРАЩАТЬСЯ ЖЕ С ПУСТЫМИ РУКАМИ.    СОТНИКОВ ЗЯБКО ПОДРАГИВАЛ ОТ ХОЛОДА:  НА  ВЕТРУ  НАЧАЛ  ЛЮТО  ПРОБИРАТЬ МОРОЗ. ЧТОБЫ КАК-ТО СОХРАНИТЬ  ОСТАТКИ  ТЕПЛА,  ОН  ВСЕ  ГЛУБЖЕ  ЗАСОВЫВАЛ ОЗЯБШИЕ РУКИ В ШИРОКИЕ РУКАВА ШИНЕЛИ.    - ЧТО ТЫ ШАПКИ КАКОЙ НЕ ДОСТАЛ? РАЗВЕ ЭТА СОГРЕЕТ? - С  УПРЕКОМ  СКАЗАЛ РЫБАК.    - ШАПКИ ЖЕ В ЛЕСУ НЕ РАСТУТ.    - ЗАТО В ДЕРЕВНЕ У КАЖДОГО МУЖИКА ШАПКА.    СОТНИКОВ ОТВЕТИЛ НЕ СРАЗУ.    - ЧТО ЖЕ, С МУЖИКА СНИМАТЬ?    - НЕ ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО СНИМАТЬ. МОЖНО И ЕЩЕ КАК.    - ЛАДНО, ДАВАЙ ПОТОПАЛИ, - ОБОРВАЛ РАЗГОВОР СОТНИКОВ.    ОНИ ПЕРЕЛЕЗЛИ ЧЕРЕЗ ИЗГОРОДЬ И СРАЗУ ОКАЗАЛИСЬ В  ПОЛЕ.  СОТНИКОВ  ВРАЗ ССУТУЛИЛСЯ, ГЛУБЖЕ ВТЯНУЛ В ВОРОТНИК МАЛЕНЬКУЮ В ПИЛОТКЕ ГОЛОВУ, НОРОВЯ НА ХОДУ  ОТВЕРНУТЬСЯ  ОТ  ВЕТРА.  РЫБАК  ОТКУДА-ТО   ИЗ-ЗА   ПАЗУХИ   ВЫТАЩИЛ ЗАМУСОЛЕННОЕ,  БУДТО  ПОРТЯНКА,  ВАФЕЛЬНОЕ  ПОЛОТЕНЦЕ  И,  СТРЯХНУВ   ЕГО, ПОВЕРНУЛСЯ К НАПАРНИКУ.    - НА, ОБМОТАЙ ШЕЮ. ВСЕ ТЕПЛЕЙ БУДЕТ.    - ДА ЛАДНО...    - НА, НА! А ТО, ГЛЯДИ, СОВСЕМ ОКОЧУРИШЬСЯ.    СОТНИКОВ  НЕХОТЯ  ОСТАНОВИЛСЯ,   ЗАЖАЛ   МЕЖДУ   КОЛЕНЕЙ   ВИНТОВКУ   И СКРЮЧЕННЫМИ, НЕГНУЩИМИСЯ ПАЛЬЦАМИ КОЕ-КАК ЗАКУТАЛ ПОЛОТЕНЦЕМ ШЕЮ.    - НУ ВО! - УДОВЛЕТВОРЕННО СКАЗАЛ РЫБАК.  -  А  ТЕПЕРЬ  ДАВАЙ  РВАНЕМ  В ГУЗАКИ. ТУТ ПАРА КИЛОМЕТРОВ, НЕ БОЛЬШЕ. ЧТО-НИБУДЬ РАССТАРАЕМСЯ, НЕ  МОЖЕТ БЫТЬ...    	•	2     В ПОЛЕ БЫЛО ЕЩЕ  ХОЛОДНЕЕ,  ЧЕМ  В  ЛЕСУ,  НАВСТРЕЧУ  ДУЛ  УПРУГИЙ,  НЕ СИЛЬНЫЙ,  НО  ОБЖИГАЮЩЕ-МОРОЗНЫЙ  ВЕТЕР,  ОТ  НЕГО  ДО   БОЛИ   ЗАХОДИЛИСЬ ОКОЧЕНЕВШИЕ БЕЗ ПЕРЧАТОК РУКИ: КАК СОТНИКОВ НИ ПРЯТАЛ ИХ ТО В КАРМАНЫ,  ТО В РУКАВА, ТО ЗА ПАЗУХУ - ВСЕ РАВНО МЕРЗЛИ.  ТУТ  НЕДОЛГО  БЫЛО  ОБМОРОЗИТЬ ЛИЦО И ОСОБЕННО УШИ, КОТОРЫЕ СОТНИКОВ, МОРЩАСЬ ОТ  БОЛИ,  ТО  И  ДЕЛО  ТЕР СУКОННЫМ РУКАВОМ ШИНЕЛИ. ЗА НОГИ ОН НЕ ОПАСАЛСЯ: НОГИ  В  ХОДЬБЕ  ГРЕЛИСЬ. ПРАВДА, НА ПРАВОЙ ОТНЯЛИСЬ,  ПОТЕРЯВ  ЧУВСТВИТЕЛЬНОСТЬ,  ДВА  ПОМОРОЖЕННЫХ ПАЛЬЦА, НО ОНИ ОТНИМАЛИСЬ ВСЕГДА НА МОРОЗЕ  И  ОБЫЧНО  НАЧИНАЛИ  БОЛЕТЬ  В ТЕПЛЕ. НО НА ХОЛОДЕ МУЧИТЕЛЬНО НЫЛО ВСЕ  ЕГО  БОЛЬНОЕ  ПРОСТУЖЕННОЕ  ТЕЛО, КОТОРОЕ СЕГОДНЯ ВДОБАВОК КО ВСЕМУ НАЧАЛО ЕЩЕ И ЛИХОРАДИТЬ.    ИМ ЕЩЕ ПОВЕЗЛО - СНЕГ В  ПОЛЕ  БЫЛ  ДОСТАТОЧНО  ТВЕРД  ИЛИ  НЕ  СЛИШКОМ ГЛУБОК, ОНИ ПОЧТИ ВСЮДУ ДЕРЖАЛИСЬ ПОВЕРХУ, ЛИШЬ  МЕСТАМИ  ПРОВАЛИВАЯСЬ  ТО ОДНОЙ, ТО ДРУГОЙ НОГОЙ, ПРОЛАМЫВАЯ ЗАТВЕРДЕВШИЙ ОТ МОРОЗА НАСТ. ТЕПЕРЬ ШЛИ ВДОЛЬ ГРИВКИ БУРЬЯНА ПО СКЛОНУ ВНИЗ. В ПОЛЕ БЫЛО НЕМНОГО  СВЕТЛЕЕ,  ЧЕМ  В ЛЕСУ, СЕРЫЙ ПРИЗРАЧНЫЙ СУМРАК ВОКРУГ  РАЗДВИНУЛСЯ  ШИРЕ,  ВНИЗУ  НА  СНЕГУ МЕЛЬТЕШИЛИ ОТ ВЕТРА СУХИЕ СТЕБЛИ БУРЬЯНА.  СПУСТЯ  ЧЕТВЕРТЬ  ЧАСА  ВПЕРЕДИ ЗАТЕМНЕЛСЯ КАКОЙ-ТО КУСТАРНИК - СПУТАННЫЕ ЗАРОСЛИ  ЛОЗНЯКА  ИЛИ  ОЛЬШАНИКА НАД РЕЧКОЙ, И ОНИ НЕ СПЕША ПОШЛИ К ЭТИМ ЗАРОСЛЯМ.    СОТНИКОВ ЧУВСТВОВАЛ  СЕБЯ  ВСЕ  ХУЖЕ:  КРУЖИЛАСЬ  ГОЛОВА,  ВРЕМЕНАМИ  В СОЗНАНИИ ЧТО-ТО КАК БУДТО ПРОВАЛИВАЛОСЬ, ИСЧЕЗАЛО ИЗ ПАМЯТИ,  И  ТОГДА  НА КОРОТКОЕ ВРЕМЯ ОН ДАЖЕ ЗАБЫВАЛ, ГДЕ НАХОДИТСЯ И  КТО  С  НИМ.  НАВЕРНО,  В САМОМ ДЕЛЕ НАДО БЫЛО ВОРОТИТЬСЯ ИЛИ ВОВСЕ НЕ ТРОГАТЬСЯ  ИЗ  ЛЕСА  В  ТАКОМ СОСТОЯНИИ, НО ОН ПРОСТО НЕ ДОПУСКАЛ МЫСЛИ, ЧТО МОЖЕТ ВСЕРЬЕЗ ЗАБОЛЕТЬ.  НЕ ХВАТАЛО ЕЩЕ БОЛЕТЬ НА ВОЙНЕ. НИКТО ИЗ НИХ НЕ БОЛЕЛ ТАК, ЧТОБЫ  ОСВОБОЖДАЛИ ОТ ЗАДАНИЙ, ДА ЕЩЕ ТАКИХ  ПУСТЯКОВЫХ,  КАК  ЭТО.  КАШЛЯЛИ,  ПРОСТУЖИВАЛИСЬ МНОГИЕ, НО ПРОСТУДА НЕ СЧИТАЛАСЬ В ЛЕСУ БОЛЕЗНЬЮ. И КОГДА ТАМ, У КОСТРА НА БОЛОТЕ, КОМАНДИР ВЫЗВАЛ ЕГО ПО ФАМИЛИИ, СОТНИКОВ НЕ ПОДУМАЛ О  БОЛЕЗНИ.  А УЗНАВ, ЧТО ПРЕДСТОИТ СХОДИТЬ  В  СЕЛО  ЗА  ПРОДУКТАМИ,  ДАЖЕ  ОБРАДОВАЛСЯ, ПОТОМУ ЧТО ВСЕ ЭТИ ДНИ БЫЛ  ГОЛОДЕН,  К  ТОМУ  ЖЕ  ПРИВЛЕКАЛА  ВОЗМОЖНОСТЬ КАКОЙ-НИБУДЬ ЧАС ПОГРЕТЬСЯ В ДОМАШНЕМ ТЕПЛЕ.    И ВОТ ПОГРЕЛСЯ.    В ЛЕСУ ВСЕ-ТАКИ БЫЛО ЛЕГЧЕ, А  ТУТ,  НА  ВЕТРУ,  ОН  ПОЧУВСТВОВАЛ  СЕБЯ СОВСЕМ ПЛОХО И ДАЖЕ ИСПУГАЛСЯ, ЧТО МОЖЕТ УПАСТЬ: ТАК КРУЖИЛАСЬ  ГОЛОВА,  И ОТ СЛАБОСТИ ВЕЛО ИЗ СТОРОНЫ В СТОРОНУ.    - НУ, КАК ТЫ?    ОСТАНОВИВШИСЬ, РЫБАК ОБЕРНУЛСЯ,  ПОДОЖДАЛ,  И  ОТ  ЭТОГО  ЕГО  ПРОСТОГО ВОПРОСА, НА КОТОРЫЙ НЕ ОБЯЗАТЕЛЬНО БЫЛО ОТВЕЧАТЬ, У СОТНИКОВА ПОТЕПЛЕЛО  В ДУШЕ. БОЛЬШЕ ВСЕГО ОН БОЯЛСЯ ИЗ НАПАРНИКА ПРЕВРАТИТЬСЯ  В  ОБУЗУ,  ХОТЯ  И ЗНАЛ, ЧТО, ЕСЛИ СЛУЧИТСЯ НАИХУДШЕЕ, ВЫХОД ДЛЯ СЕБЯ НАЙДЕТ САМ,  НИКОГО  НЕ ОБРЕМЕНЯЯ. ДАЖЕ И РЫБАКА, НА КОТОРОГО КАК  БУДТО  МОЖНО  БЫЛО  ПОЛОЖИТЬСЯ. ПОСЛЕ НЕДАВНЕГО ПЕРЕХОДА ШОССЕ,  КОГДА  ИМ  ДВОИМ  ВЫПАЛО  ПРИКРЫТЬ  ОТХОД ОСТАТКОВ РАЗБИТОГО  ОТРЯДА,  ОНИ  КАК-ТО  СБЛИЗИЛИСЬ  МЕЖДУ  СОБОЙ  И  ВСЕ ПОСЛЕДНИЕ ДНИ ДЕРЖАЛИСЬ ВМЕСТЕ. НАВЕРНО, ПОТОМУ ВМЕСТЕ  ПОПАЛИ  И  НА  ЭТО ЗАДАНИЕ.    - ВОТ ЛОЩИНУ ПРОТОПАЕМ, А ТАМ ЗА БУГРОМ  И  ДЕРЕВНЯ.  НЕДАЛЕКО  УЖЕ,  - ПОДБАДРИВАЛ РЫБАК, ЗАМЕДЛЯЯ ШАГ, ЧТОБЫ ИДТИ РЯДОМ.    СОТНИКОВ ДОГНАЛ ЕГО, И ОНИ  ВМЕСТЕ  ПОШЛИ  ПО  СКЛОНУ.  СНЕГ  ТУТ  СТАЛ ГЛУБЖЕ, ЧЕМ БЫЛ НА ПРИГОРКЕ, НОГИ ЧАЩЕ ПРОЛАМЫВАЛИ ТОНКОВАТЫЙ НАСТ;  МЕСЯЦ ТЕПЕРЬ БЛЕСТЕЛ ЗА ИХ СПИНАМИ. ВЕТЕР СИЛЬНЫМИ ПОРЫВАМИ  РАЗДОЛЬНО  ГУЛЯЛ  В СНЕЖНОМ ПОЛЕ, КОРОТКИЕ ПОЛЫ ШИПЕЛИ ХЛЕСТАЛИ ПО ОЗЯБШИМ КОЛЕНЯМ  СОТНИКОВА. РЫБАК ВДРУГ ОБЕРНУЛСЯ К ТОВАРИЩУ:    - ВСЕ СПРОСИТЬ ХОЧУ: В АРМИИ ТЫ КЕМ БЫЛ? НАВЕРНО, НЕ РЯДОВЫМ, А?    - КОМБАТОМ.    - В ПЕХОТЕ?    - В АРТИЛЛЕРИИ.    - НУ ТОГДА ЯСНОЕ ДЕЛО: МАЛО ХОДИЛ. А Я ВОТ В ПЕХОТЕ ВСЮ ДОРОГУ ТОПАЮ.    - И ДАЛЕКО ПРОТОПАЛ? - СПРОСИЛ СОТНИКОВ, ВСПОМИНАЯ СВОЙ ПУТЬ НА ВОСТОК.    НО РЫБАК ЭТО ПОНЯЛ ИНАЧЕ.    - ДА ВОТ КАК ВИДИШЬ. ОТ СТАРШИНЫ ДО РЯДОВОГО ДОШЕЛ. А ТЫ КАДРОВЫЙ?    - НЕ СОВСЕМ. ДО ТРИДЦАТЬ ДЕВЯТОГО В ШКОЛЕ РАБОТАЛ.    - ЧТО, ИНСТИТУТ ОКОНЧИЛ?    - УЧИТЕЛЬСКИЙ. ДВУХГОДИЧНЫЙ.    - А Я, ЗНАЕШЬ, ПЯТЬ КЛАССОВ ВСЕГО... И ТО...    РЫБАК НЕ ДОГОВОРИЛ - ВДРУГ ПРОВАЛИЛСЯ ОБЕИМИ НОГАМИ, НЕГРОМКО ВЫРУГАЛСЯ И ВЗЯЛ НЕСКОЛЬКО В СТОРОНУ. ТУТ УЖЕ  НАЧИНАЛСЯ  КУСТАРНИК,  ЗАРОСЛИ  ЛОЗЫ, КАМЫША, СНЕГ СТАЛ РЫХЛЕЕ И ПОЧТИ НЕ ДЕРЖАЛ НАВЕРХУ; ПОД  НОГАМИ,  КАЖЕТСЯ, БЫЛО  БОЛОТО.  СОТНИКОВ  В  НЕРЕШИТЕЛЬНОСТИ  ОСТАНОВИЛСЯ,  ВЫБИРАЯ,   КУДА СТУПИТЬ.    - ЗА МНОЙ, ЗА МНОЙ ДЕРЖИ. ПО СЛЕДАМ, ТАК ЛЕГЧЕ, - ИЗДАЛИ СКАЗАЛ  РЫБАК, НАПРАВЛЯЯСЬ В КУСТАРНИК.    ОНИ ДОЛГО ПРОБИРАЛИСЬ ПО ШИРОКОЙ  ПОЙМЕННОЙ  ЛОЩИНЕ,  ПОКА  ВЫЛЕЗЛИ  ИЗ ЗАРОСЛЕЙ  МЕРЗЛОГО  ТРОСТНИКА,  ОТЧАЯННО  ШЕЛЕСТЕВШЕГО   ВОКРУГ,   ПЕРЕШЛИ ЗАСЫПАННУЮ СНЕГОМ РЕЧУШКУ И СНОВА ПОШЛИ ЛУГОМ,  РАЗГРЕБАЯ  НОГАМИ  РЫХЛЫЙ, ГЛУБОКИЙ СНЕГ. СОТНИКОВ СОВЕРШЕННО ИЗНЕМОГ, ТЯЖЕЛО ДЫШАЛ И ЕДВА  ДОЖДАЛСЯ, КОГДА КОНЧИТСЯ ЭТА БОЛОТИСТАЯ НИЗИНА И НАЧНЕТСЯ  ПОЛЕ.  НАКОНЕЦ  КУСТАРНИК ОСТАЛСЯ ПОЗАДИ, ПЕРЕД НИМИ ПОЛОГО  ПОДНИМАЛСЯ  СКЛОН,  СНЕГА  ЗДЕСЬ  СТАЛО МЕНЬШЕ. НО ИДТИ ВВЕРХ ОКАЗАЛОСЬ НЕ ЛЕГЧЕ. СОТНИКОВА ВСЕ  БОЛЬШЕ  ОДОЛЕВАЛА УСТАЛОСТЬ, ПОЯВИЛОСЬ КАКОЕ-ТО СТРАННОЕ БЕЗРАЗЛИЧИЕ КО ВСЕМУ  НА  СВЕТЕ.  В УШАХ ТЯГУЧЕ, СО ЗВОНОМ ГУДЕЛО - ОТ ВЕТРА ИЛИ, МОЖЕТ, ОТ  УСТАЛОСТИ,  И  ОН ОГРОМНЫМ УСИЛИЕМ ВОЛИ ПРИНУЖДАЛ СЕБЯ ДВИГАТЬСЯ, ЧТОБЫ НЕ УПАСТЬ.    НА СЕРЕДИНЕ ДЛИННОГО СКЛОНА СТАЛО И ВОВСЕ  ПЛОХО:  ПОДКАШИВАЛИСЬ  НОГИ. ХОРОШО ЕЩЕ, ЧТО СНЕГУ ТУТ БЫЛО МАЛО,  А  МЕСТАМИ  ЕГО  И  ВОВСЕ  ПОСДУВАЛО ВЕТРОМ, И ТОГДА ПОД БУРКАМИ ПРОСТУПАЛИ ПЫЛЬНЫЕ  ГЛИНИСТЫЕ  ПЛЕШИНЫ.  РЫБАК ВЫРВАЛСЯ ДАЛЕКО ВПЕРЕД - НАВЕРНО, СТАРАЛСЯ ДОСТИЧЬ  ВЕРШИНЫ  ХОЛМА,  ЧТОБЫ ОГЛЯДЕТЬСЯ, - КАЖЕТСЯ, УЖЕ СКОРО ДОЛЖНА БЫЛА ПОЯВИТЬСЯ ДЕРЕВНЯ. НО ЕЩЕ  НЕ ДОЙДЯ ДО ВЕРШИНЫ, ОН ОСТАНОВИЛСЯ. СОТНИКОВУ ПОКАЗАЛОСЬ ИЗДАЛИ, ЧТО ОН  ТАМ ЧТО-ТО УВИДЕЛ, ПО ОТСЮДА ЕМУ ПЛОХО БЫЛО ВИДНО, ЧТО ИМЕННО.  СНЕГОВОЙ  ХОЛМ ПОЛОГО ПОДНИМАЛСЯ К ЗВЕЗДНОМУ НЕБУ И ГДЕ-ТО  РАСТВОРЯЛСЯ  ТАМ,  ИСЧЕЗАЯ  В ТУСКЛОМ МАРЕВЕ НОЧИ. ПОЗАДИ  ЖЕ  ШИРОКО  И  ПРОСТОРНО  РАСКИНУЛАСЬ  СЕРАЯ, ПРИТУМАНЕННАЯ  РАВНИНА   С   ПРЕРЫВИСТОЙ   ПОЛОСОЙ   КУСТАРНИКА,   СЛАБЫМИ ОЧЕРТАНИЯМИ КАКИХ-ТО ПЯТЕН, РАСПЛЫВЧАТЫХ ТЕНЕЙ, А  ЕЩЕ  ДАЛЬШЕ,  ПОЧТИ  НЕ ПРОСМАТРИВАЯСЬ ОТСЮДА, ЗАТАИЛСЯ В ТЕМЕНИ ПОКИНУТЫЙ ИМИ ЛЕС. ОН БЫЛ ДАЛЕКО, ТОТ ЛЕС, А ВОКРУГ СТЫЛО НА МОРОЗЕ НОЧНОЕ ПОЛЕ - ЕСЛИ ЧТО СЛУЧИТСЯ,  ПОМОЩИ ЖДАТЬ НЕОТКУДА.    РЫБАК ВСЕ ЕЩЕ СТОЯЛ, ОТВЕРНУВШИСЬ  ОТ  ВЕТРА,  КОГДА  СОТНИКОВ  КОЕ-КАК ПРИВОЛОКСЯ К НЕМУ. ОН УЖЕ НЕ ПРИДЕРЖИВАЛСЯ ЕГО СЛЕДА - СТУПАЛ КУДА ПОПАЛО, ЛИШЬ БЫ НЕ УПАСТЬ. И, ПОДОЙДЯ, НЕОЖИДАННО УВИДЕЛ: ПОД НОГАМИ БЫЛА ДОРОГА.    ОНИ НИЧЕГО НЕ СКАЗАЛИ ДРУГ ДРУГУ,  ВСЛУШАЛИСЬ,  ВГЛЯДЕЛИСЬ  И  МЕДЛЕННО ПОШЛИ ВВЕРХ - ОДИН ПО ПРАВОЙ, А ДРУГОЙ ПО  ЛЕВОЙ  КОЛЕЯМ  ДОРОГИ.  ДОРОГА, НАВЕРНО, ВЕЛА В ДЕРЕВНЮ -  ЗНАЧИТ,  МОЖЕТ,  ЕЩЕ  УДАСТСЯ  ДОЙТИ  ТУДА,  НЕ СВАЛИТЬСЯ В ПУТИ. ВОКРУГ ПРОСТИРАЛСЯ ВСЕ ТОТ ЖЕ ПРИЗРАЧНЫЙ НОЧНОЙ  ПРОСТОР - СЕРОЕ ПОЛЕ, СНЕГ, СУМРАК СО  МНОЖЕСТВОМ  НЕУЛОВИМЫХ  ТЕНЕВЫХ  ПЕРЕХОДОВ, ПЯТЕН. И НИГДЕ НЕ БЫЛО ВИДНО НИ ОГОНЬКА, НИ ДВИЖЕНИЯ -  СМОЛКЛА,  ЗАТИХЛА, ПРИТАИЛАСЬ ЗЕМЛЯ.    - СТОЙ!    СОТНИКОВ ШАГНУЛ И ЗАМЕР, КОРОТКО СКРИПНУЛ И ЗАТИХ ПОД ЕГО БУРКАМИ СНЕГ. РЯДОМ НЕПОДВИЖНО ЗАСТЫЛ РЫБАК.  ОТКУДА-ТО  С  ТОЙ  СТОРОНЫ,  КУДА  УХОДИЛА ДОРОГА, НЕВНЯТНО  ДОНЕССЯ  ГОЛОС,  ОБРЫВОК  КАКОГО-ТО  ОКРИКА  ВЫРВАЛСЯ  В МОРОЗНУЮ НОЧЬ И ПРОПАЛ. ОНИ ТРЕВОЖНО ВГЛЯДЕЛИСЬ В НОЧЬ - НЕДАЛЕКО ВПЕРЕДИ, В ЛОЖБИНКЕ, ПОХОЖЕ, БЫЛА  ДЕРЕВНЯ:  НЕРОВНАЯ  ПОЛОСА  ЧЕГО-ТО  ГРОМОЗДКОГО МЯГКО СЕРЕЛА В СУМРАКЕ. НО НИЧЕГО ОПРЕДЕЛЕННОГО ТАМ НЕЛЬЗЯ БЫЛО РАЗОБРАТЬ.    ЗАМЕРЕВ НА ДОРОГЕ, ОБА ВСМАТРИВАЛИСЬ, НЕ  БУДУЧИ  В  СОСТОЯНИИ  ПОНЯТЬ, ДЕЙСТВИТЕЛЬНО ЛИ  ЭТО  БЫЛ  КРИК  ИЛИ,  МОЖЕТ,  ИМ  ПОКАЗАЛОСЬ.  ВОКРУГ  С ПРИСВИСТОМ ШУРШАЛ В БУРЬЯНЕ ВЕТЕР И ЛЕЖАЛА НЕМАЯ МОРОЗНАЯ  НОЧЬ.  И  ВДРУГ СНОВА, ГОРАЗДО УЖЕ ЯВСТВЕННЕЙ, ЧЕМ ПРЕЖДЕ,  ДОНЕССЯ  ЧЕЛОВЕЧЕСКИЙ  КРИК  - КОМАНДА  ИЛИ,  МОЖЕТ,  РУГАТЕЛЬСТВО,  А  ЗАТЕМ,  РАЗОМ  УНИЧТОЖАЯ  ВСЕ  ИХ СОМНЕНИЯ, ВДАЛИ БАБАХНУЛ И ЭХОМ ПРОКАТИЛСЯ ПО ПОЛЮ ВЫСТРЕЛ.    РЫБАК, ЧТО-ТО ПОНЯВ,  С  ОБЛЕГЧЕНИЕМ  ВЫДОХНУЛ,  А  СОТНИКОВ,  НАВЕРНО, ОТТОГО, ЧТО ДОЛГО СДЕРЖИВАЛ ДЫХАНИЕ, ВДРУГ ЗАКАШЛЯЛСЯ.    МИНУТУ ЕГО НЕОТВЯЗНО БИЛ КАШЕЛЬ, КАК ОН  НИ  СТАРАЛСЯ  УНЯТЬ  ЕГО,  ВСЕ ПРИСЛУШИВАЯСЬ, НЕ ДОНЕСУТСЯ ЛИ НОВЫЕ ЗВУКИ. ПРАВДА, И БЕЗ  ТОГО  УЖЕ  БЫЛО ПОНЯТНО, ЧЕЙ ЭТО ВЫСТРЕЛ: КТО ЖЕ ЕЩЕ, КРОМЕ НЕМЦЕВ  ИЛИ  ИХ  ПРИСЛУЖНИКОВ, МОГ В ТАКУЮ ПОРУ СТРЕЛЯТЬ В ДЕРЕВНЕ? ЗНАЧИТ, И В ТОМ НАПРАВЛЕНИИ  ПУТЬ  ИМ ЗАКРЫТ, НАДО ПОВОРАЧИВАТЬ ОБРАТНО.    ВЫСТРЕЛОВ, ОДНАКО, БОЛЬШЕ НЕ БЫЛО, РАЗА ДВА ВЕТЕР ДОНЕС ЧТО-ТО  ПОХОЖЕЕ НА ГОЛОС - РАЗГОВОР ИЛИ ОКРИК, НЕ РАЗОБРАТЬ. ВЫЖДАВ, РЫБАК СКВОЗЬ ЗУБЫ ЗЛО СПЛЮНУЛ НА СНЕГ.    - ШУРУЮТ, СВОЛОЧИ! ДЛЯ ВЕЛИКОЙ ГЕРМАНИИ.    ОНИ ЕЩЕ ПОСТОЯЛИ НЕДОЛГО, ПРИСЛУШИВАЯСЬ К ВЕТРЕНОЙ ТИШИ,  ОБЕСПОКОЕННЫЕ ВОПРОСОМ: ЧТО ДЕЛАТЬ ДАЛЬШЕ, КУДА ПОДАТЬСЯ? БУДТО ЕЩЕ НА  ЧТО-ТО  НАДЕЯСЬ, РЫБАК ПРОДОЛЖАЛ ВГЛЯДЫВАТЬСЯ В ТУ СТОРОНУ, ГДЕ ВО МРАКЕ  ИСЧЕЗАЛА  ДОРОГА; СОТНИКОВ ЖЕ, ОТВЕРНУВШИСЬ ОТ ВЕТРА, НАЧИНАЛ МЕЛКО, ПРОСТУДНО ДРОЖАТЬ.    - ЗНАЧИТ, ТУДА НЕЧЕГО И СОВАТЬСЯ, - РЕШИЛ РЫБАК, ОЗАДАЧЕННО ПЕРЕМИНАЯСЬ НА  СКРИПУЧЕМ  СНЕГУ.  -  МОЖЕТ,  ДАВАЙ  ЛОЖБИНКОЙ  ПРОЙДЕМ?  ТУТ  ГДЕ-ТО, ПОМНИТСЯ, ЕЩЕ ДОЛЖНА БЫТЬ ДЕРЕВУШКА.    - ДАВАЙ, - ОДНОСЛОЖНО СОГЛАСИЛСЯ СОТНИКОВ И ЗЯБКО ПЕРЕДЕРНУЛ ПЛЕЧАМИ.    ЕМУ БЫЛО ВСЕ РАВНО КУДА ИДТИ, ЛИШЬ БЫ НЕ СТОЯТЬ НА  ЭТОМ  ПРОНИЗЫВАЮЩЕМ ВЕТРУ. ЧУВСТВА ЕГО ДРЕМОТНО ТУПЕЛИ, ПО-ПРЕЖНЕМУ КРУЖИЛАСЬ ГОЛОВА. ВСЕ  ЕГО УСИЛИЯ ТЕПЕРЬ УХОДИЛИ ТОЛЬКО НА ТО, ЧТОБЫ НЕ СПОТКНУТЬСЯ, НЕ  УПАСТЬ,  ИБО ТОГДА ОН, НАВЕРНОЕ, УЖЕ НЕ ПОДНЯЛСЯ БЫ.    ОНИ СВЕРНУЛИ С ДОРОГИ И ПО СНЕЖНОЙ ЦЕЛИНЕ НАПРАВИЛИСЬ ТУДА, ГДЕ ШИРОКИМ ПЯТНОМ ТЕМНЕЛ КАКОЙ-ТО КУСТАРНИК. СНЕГ НА СКЛОНЕ СНАЧАЛА  БЫЛ  МЕЛКИЙ,  ПО ЩИКОЛОТКУ, НО ПОСТЕПЕННО СТАНОВИЛСЯ ВСЕ  ГЛУБЖЕ,  ОСОБЕННО  В  НИЗИНКЕ.  К СЧАСТЬЮ, НИЗИНКА ОКАЗАЛАСЬ НЕШИРОКОЙ, ОНИ СКОРО  ПЕРЕШЛИ  ЕЕ  И  ПОВЕРНУЛИ ВДОЛЬ ЗАРОСЛЕЙ МЕЛКОЛЕСЬЯ, БЛИЗКО, ОДНАКО,  НЕ  ПОДХОДЯ  К  НИМ.  СОТНИКОВ ПЛОХО ОРИЕНТИРОВАЛСЯ НА ЭТОЙ МЕСТНОСТИ И  ВО  ВСЕМ  ПОЛАГАЛСЯ  НА  РЫБАКА, КОТОРЫЙ ОБЛАЗИЛ ЗДЕШНИЕ МЕСТА  ЕЩЕ  ОСЕНЬЮ,  ПО  ЧЕРНОЙ  ТРОПЕ,  КОГДА  ИХ НЕБОЛЬШОЙ ОТРЯД ТОЛЬКО  ЕЩЕ  СОБИРАЛ  СИЛЫ  НА  ГОРЕЛОМ  БОЛОТЕ.  НАЧАВ  С НЕБОЛЬШОЙ ДИВЕРСИИ НА ДОРОГЕ, ЭТОТ ОТРЯД ЗАТЕМ ПЕРЕШЕЛ К ДЕЛАМ ПОВАЖНЕЕ  - ВЗОРВАЛ МОСТ НА ИСЛЯНКЕ, СЖЕГ ЛЬНОЗАВОД  В  МЕСТЕЧКЕ,  НО  ПОСЛЕ  УБИЙСТВА КАКОГО-ТО КРУПНОГО НЕМЕЦКОГО ЧИНОВНИКА  ОККУПАНТЫ  ВСПОЛОШИЛИСЬ.  В  КОНЦЕ НОЯБРЯ ТРИ РОТЫ  ЖАНДАРМОВ,  ОЦЕПИВ  ГОРЕЛОЕ  БОЛОТО,  НАЧАЛИ  ОБЛАВУ,  ИЗ КОТОРОЙ ОНИ ЕДВА ВЫРВАЛИСЬ ТОГДА В СОСЕДНИЙ БОРКОВСКИЙ ЛЕС.    СОТНИКОВ, ОДНАКО, В ТО ВРЕМЯ БЫЛ ДАЛЕКО ОТСЮДА И  ЕДВА  ЛИ  ПОМЫШЛЯЛ  О ПАРТИЗАНАХ. ОН ДЕЛАЛ ТРЕТЬЮ ПОПЫТКУ ПРОБИТЬСЯ  ЧЕРЕЗ  ЛИНИЮ  ФРОНТА  И  НЕ ДОПУСКАЛ  МЫСЛИ,  ЧТО  МОЖЕТ  ОКАЗАТЬСЯ  ВНЕ   АРМИИ.   ДВЕНАДЦАТЬ   СУТОК ПРОБИРАЛАСЬ ИЗ-ПОД СЛОНИМА НА ВОСТОК НЕБОЛЬШАЯ ГРУППА АРТИЛЛЕРИСТОВ - ТЕХ, КТО УЦЕЛЕЛ ИЗ ВСЕГО КОГДА-ТО МОЩНОГО КОРПУСНОГО АРТИЛЛЕРИЙСКОГО ПОЛКА.  НО НА БЕРЕЗИНЕ ВО ВРЕМЯ ПЕРЕПРАВЫ ПОЧТИ ВСЯ ОНА БЫЛА РАССТРЕЛЯНА ИЗ ЗАСАДЫ, А КТО УЦЕЛЕЛ ИЛИ НЕ ПОШЕЛ КО ДНУ, ОЧУТИЛСЯ В ПЛЕНУ У НЕМЦЕВ.  В  ЧИСЛЕ  ЭТИХ ПОСЛЕДНИХ, НА СЧАСТЬЕ ИЛИ БЕДУ, ОКАЗАЛСЯ И СОТНИКОВ.    ДА, ЭТО БЫЛИ ОТЛИЧНЫЕ РЕБЯТА, ЕГО АРТИЛЛЕРИСТЫ, РАЗВЕДЧИКИ, ОГНЕВИКИ  И СВЯЗИСТЫ. КРУГЛЫЙ ГОД ОН ПОЛУЧАЛ С НИМИ ТОЛЬКО ПЯТЕРКИ И БЛАГОДАРНОСТИ  ОТ НАЧАЛЬСТВА ЗА БОЕВУЮ ПОДГОТОВКУ, МАСТЕРСТВО И МЕТКУЮ СТРЕЛЬБУ НА ПОЛКОВЫХ, АРМЕЙСКИХ И ПОКАЗНЫХ УЧЕНИЯХ.  ДУМАЛОСЬ,  РАЗРАЗИТСЯ  ВОЙНА,  И  ИМ  БУДУТ ОБЕСПЕЧЕНЫ БЛЕСТЯЩАЯ ПОБЕДА, ОРДЕНА, ГАЗЕТНАЯ СЛАВА И ВСЕ ПРОЧЕЕ,  К  ЧЕМУ ОНИ БЫЛИ ВПОЛНЕ ПОДГОТОВЛЕНЫ И ЧЕГО, БЕЗУСЛОВНО, ЗАСЛУЖИВАЛИ.  ПО  КРАЙНЕЙ МЕРЕ, БОЛЬШЕ ДРУГИХ.    НО НА ВОЙНЕ ВСЕ ПОЛУЧИЛОСЬ ИНАЧЕ. СЛУЧИЛОСЬ  ТАК,  ЧТО  В  РАСПОРЯЖЕНИИ БАТАРЕИ ОСТАЛОСЬ НЕСКОЛЬКО СЧИТАННЫХ СЕКУНД, И НАИБОЛЬШИЙ  РЕЗУЛЬТАТ  ДАЛИ ТЕ, КТО СКОРЕЕ  СОРИЕНТИРОВАЛСЯ,  ПРОВОРНЕЕ  УСПЕЛ  ЗАРЯДИТЬ,  КТО  ПРОСТО ОКАЗАЛСЯ ЛОВЧЕЕ И НЕ РАСТЕРЯЛСЯ В МОМЕНТ, КОГДА У  НЕГО  САМОГО  ЗАДРОЖАЛИ РУКИ.    РЫБАК  УВЕРЕННО  ШАГАЛ  ВПЕРЕДИ  ВДОЛЬ  ОПУШКИ  ЛЕСКА.  СОТНИКОВ  ОПЯТЬ ПРИОТСТАЛ, ЕГО СУКОННЫЕ РАСТОПТАННЫЕ БУРКИ,  НЕДАВНО  ДОСТАВШИЕСЯ  ЕМУ  ОТ УБИТОГО ПАРТИЗАНА ИЗ МЕСТНЫХ, РОВНО ШОРХАЛИ ПО  СНЕЖНОЙ  ЗАМЯТИ.  ИХ  ПУТЬ ЛЕЖАЛ  ВНИЗ,  ВЕТЕР  ЗАХОДИЛ  СБОКУ,  МЕСЯЦ  ТУСКЛО  И  РОВНО  БЛЕСТЕЛ   С НЕБОСКЛОНА. ПО-ПРЕЖНЕМУ БЫЛО МОРОЗНО И ВЕТРЕНО, ОТ СТУЖИ У  СОТНИКОВА  ВСЕ СЖАЛОСЬ, ОДЕРЕВЕНЕЛО ВНУТРИ. КАЗАЛОСЬ, НИКОГДА В  ЖИЗНИ  ОН  НЕ  ИСПЫТЫВАЛ ТАКОГО СОБАЧЬЕГО ХОЛОДА; КАК  В  ЭТУ  ФЕВРАЛЬСКУЮ  НОЧЬ.  ОТ  УСТАЛОСТИ  И ОДНООБРАЗНОГО ШУРШАНИЯ ВЕТРА  В  БУРЬЯНЕ  ГОЛОВА  ЕГО  ПОЛНИЛАСЬ  ГУЛОМ  И ПУТАНИЦЕЙ НЕВНЯТНЫХ ФРАЗ, РАЗГОВОРОВ.  В  ТУСКЛОЙ  СУМЯТИЦЕ  МЫСЛЕЙ  ПОРОЙ ЯВСТВЕННО ПРОГЛЯДЫВАЛО ЧТО-ТО ИЗ ЕГО ПРОШЛОГО...    НАИХУДШЕЕ ИЗ ВСЕГО СОСТОЯЛО ДЛЯ СОТНИКОВА В ТОМ, ЧТО ЭТО БЫЛ ЕГО ПЕРВЫЙ И ЕГО ПОСЛЕДНИЙ ФРОНТОВОЙ БОЙ, К КОТОРОМУ КОМБАТ ГОТОВИЛСЯ В ТЕЧЕНИЕ  ВСЕЙ СВОЕЙ  СЛУЖБЫ  В  АРМИИ.  К  СОЖАЛЕНИЮ,  ЭТОТ  ЗЛОСЧАСТНЫЙ  БОЙ  ЕЩЕ   РАЗ ЗАСВИДЕТЕЛЬСТВОВАЛ ТОТ НЕПРЕЛОЖНЫЙ, НО НЕРЕДКО ИГНОРИРУЕМЫЙ  ФАКТ,  ЧТО  В УСВОЕНИИ ОПЫТА ПРЕДЫДУЩЕЙ ВОЙНЫ НЕ ТОЛЬКО СИЛА, НО, НАВЕРНОЕ,  И  СЛАБОСТЬ АРМИИ. НАВЕРНО, ХАРАКТЕР КАЖДОЙ СЛЕДУЮЩЕЙ ВОЙНЫ СЛАГАЕТСЯ  НЕ  СТОЛЬКО  ИЗ ТИПИЧЕСКИХ  ЗАКОНОМЕРНОСТЕЙ  ПРЕДЫДУЩЕЙ,  СКОЛЬКО  ИЗ   НЕЗАМЕЧЕННЫХ   ИЛИ ИГНОРИРОВАННЫХ ЕЕ ИСКЛЮЧЕНИЙ И НЕОЖИДАННОСТЕЙ,  ЧТО  И  ФОРМИРУЕТ  КАК  ЕЕ ПОБЕДЫ, ТАК И ЕЕ ПОРАЖЕНИЯ. ЖАЛЬ, ЧТО СОТНИКОВ ПОНЯЛ ЭТО СЛИШКОМ ДЛЯ  СЕБЯ ПОЗДНО, КОГДА УРОКИ  ЕГО  КОРОТКОЙ  ФРОНТОВОЙ  НАУКИ  БЫЛИ  ДЛЯ  НЕГО  УЖЕ БЕСПОЛЕЗНЫ, А ВСЯ ЕГО БАТАРЕЙНАЯ МОЩЬ ПРЕВРАТИЛАСЬ В  ГРУДУ  ПОКОРЕЖЕННОГО МЕТАЛЛА НА БУЛЫЖНОМ ШОССЕ ПОД СЛОНИМОМ.    ВСЕ ЭТО ПРЕДСТАВЛЯЛОСЬ ТЕПЕРЬ КАК СТРАШНЫЙ, КОШМАРНЫЙ СОН,  И,  ХОТЯ  И ПОТОМ НА ЕГО ДОЛЮ ВЫПАЛО  НЕМАЛО  ЧУДОВИЩНЫХ  ИСПЫТАНИЙ,  ТОТ  ПЕРВЫЙ  БОЙ НИКОГДА НЕ ИЗГЛАДИТСЯ В ЕГО ПАМЯТИ.    ...ЧЕТВЕРТЫЙ  ДЕНЬ  ГРОХОЧУЩАЯ  КОЛОННА  ПОЛКА  ТАЩИЛАСЬ  ПО  ЛЕСНЫМ  И ПРОСЕЛОЧНЫМ ДОРОГАМ НА ЗАПАД, ПОТОМ СВЕРНУЛА  НА  ЮГ,  НО  НЕ  ПРОЕХАЛА  И ДЕСЯТКА КИЛОМЕТРОВ, КАК ЕЕ ПОВЕРНУЛИ НА СЕВЕР. ТРАКТОРА  СВОИМ  НЕУМОЛЧНЫМ РЕВОМ ОГЛУШАЛИ ОКРЕСТНОСТЬ, ОТ ПЕРЕГРЕВА КИПЕЛА ВОДА В РАДИАТОРАХ,  ПОТ  И ПЫЛЬ РАЗЪЕДАЛИ ЛИЦА БОЙЦОВ. С РАННЕГО УТРА  ДО  ТЕМНОТЫ  НАД  НИМИ  ВИСЕЛА НЕМЕЦКАЯ АВИАЦИЯ,  ЮНКЕРСЫ  НЕПРЕРЫВНО ОСЫПАЛИ  КОЛОННУ  БОМБАМИ.  ВСЕ  НА ДОРОГЕ БЫЛО ЗАВАЛЕНО ПЕСКОМ И ЗЕМЛЕЙ,  СМРАДНО  ГОРЕЛИ  ТЯГАЧИ,  УЦЕЛЕВШИЕ БЕЗОСТАНОВОЧНО ОБЪЕЗЖАЛИ ИХ: КОЛОННА  НЕ  ПРЕКРАЩАЛА  ДВИЖЕНИЯ.  БОЙЦЫ  СО СТАНИН БЕСПОРЯДОЧНО ПАЛИЛИ ВВЕРХ  ИЗ  ВИНТОВОК,  НО  ПОЛЬЗЫ  ОТ  ТАКОЙ  ИХ СТРЕЛЬБЫ БЫЛО МАЛО. ОНИ ДАЖЕ НЕ МОГЛИ ЗАСТАВИТЬ САМОЛЕТЫ ПОДНЯТЬСЯ ВЫШЕ, И ТЕ НОСИЛИСЬ НАД ДОРОГОЙ, ЕДВА НЕ ЗАДЕВАЯ ВЕРХУШКИ ПОСАДОК.    СОТНИКОВ СИДЕЛ НА ГОЛОВНОМ В БАТАРЕЕ ТРАКТОРЕ  И  КАК  ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ,  КАК САМОГО БОЛЬШОГО СЧАСТЬЯ ЖАЖДАЛ КОМАНДЫ СЪЕХАТЬ С ЭТОЙ ПРОКЛЯТОЙ  ДОРОГИ  И РАЗВЕРНУТЬСЯ. УЖ ОН БЫ ТОГДА ВСТРЕТИЛ НЕМЦЕВ. ОН БЫ ОБРУШИЛ НА  ИХ  ГОЛОВЫ ТАКОЕ, ЧТО ИМ И НЕ СНИЛОСЬ. НО НЕ БЫЛО ДАЖЕ КОМАНДЫ ОСТАНОВИТЬСЯ, ПОЛК ВСЕ ДВИГАЛСЯ И ДВИГАЛСЯ, И КАЖДЫЕ ДВА ЧАСА НАД  НИМ  РАЗГРУЖАЛИСЬ  ОБНАГЛЕВШИЕ  ЮНКЕРСЫ   И   ХЕЙНКЕЛИ ,  ПЕРЕД  КОТОРЫМИ  ВСЯ  ЭТА  ОГНЕВАЯ  МОЩЬ   БЫЛА БЕЗЗАЩИТНОЙ.    ТАК  НАСТУПИЛА  ПОСЛЕДНЯЯ  НОЧЬ  ИХ  БЛУЖДАНИЯ  ПО   ЗАПАДНОБЕЛОРУССКИМ ДОРОГАМ.    ПОЛК БЫЛ УЖЕ ДАЛЕКО НЕ ТОТ, ЧТО ВНАЧАЛЕ: НЕСКОЛЬКО РАСЧЕТОВ ПОГИБЛО,  В ЕГО БАТАРЕЕ ПОЧТИ ПРЯМЫМ ПОПАДАНИЕМ БОМБЫ РАЗВОРОТИЛО  НА  ДОРОГЕ  ОРУДИЕ. ПРАВДА, ТРИ ЕЩЕ ОСТАВАЛИСЬ ИСПРАВНЫМИ, РАЗВЕ ЧТО СО ВМЯТИНАМИ НА ЩИТАХ,  С ИЗОДРАННОЙ ГУСМАТИКОЙ КОЛЕС И МНОЖЕСТВОМ ОСКОЛОЧНЫХ ШРАМОВ  НА  СТВОЛАХ  И СТАНИНАХ. У ВТОРОГО ОРУДИЯ  ПОТЕК  ПРОБИТЫЙ  НАКАТНИК.  ЧЕТВЕРЫХ  ПОГИБШИХ БАТАРЕЙЦЫ ВЕЗЛИ, В ПРИЦЕПЕ НА СНАРЯДНЫХ ЯЩИКАХ, СЕМЕРЫХ РАНЕНЫХ  ОТПРАВИЛИ В ТЫЛ. ВПРОЧЕМ, ЭТО БЫЛИ ЕЩЕ НЕ САМЫЕ БОЛЬШИЕ  ПОТЕРИ  -  ДРУГИМ  БАТАРЕЯМ ДОСТАЛОСЬ ХУЖЕ. ПОЛКОВАЯ КОЛОННА СОКРАТИЛАСЬ ЕДВА НЕ НАПОЛОВИНУ, НЕСКОЛЬКО ОРУДИЙ ОСТАЛОСЬ НА ДОРОГЕ: ПОВРЕЖДЕННЫЕ ТРАКТОРА НЕ  МОГЛИ  ИХ  ТЯНУТЬ,  А ЗАПАСНЫХ НЕ БЫЛО. ТЕПЕРЬ ПОЧТИ ВСЮ НОЧЬ ДВИГАЛИСЬ НА ВОСТОК, И В ЭТОМ  БЫЛ ПЛОХОЙ ПРИЗНАК: ПНШ, ЗАКУРИВШИЙ ИЗ ЕГО ПАЧКИ, НАМЕКНУЛ НА ОКРУЖЕНИЕ, ОНО И В САМОМ ДЕЛЕ БЫЛО  ПОХОЖЕ  НА  ТО.  БОЙЦЫ  НЕ  СПАЛИ  ВСЕ  ЧЕТВЕРО  СУТОК, НЕКОТОРЫЕ, СИДЯ НА СТАНИНАХ, НЕМНОГО ВЗДРЕМНУЛИ ПОД УТРО - НОЧЬ БЫЛА САМОЙ СПОКОЙНОЙ ПОРОЙ, ЕСЛИ БЫ НЕ  ЭТА  НЕОПРЕДЕЛЕННОСТЬ  В  ОБСТАНОВКЕ,  ЧЕРНОЙ ПЛАХОЙ НАВИСШАЯ НАД ПОЛКОМ. ПЕРЕД РАССВЕТОМ СДЕЛАЛИ КОРОТКУЮ  ОСТАНОВКУ  В КАКОЙ-ТО ДЕРЕВНЕ, НАВСТРЕЧУ ШЛИ ПЕХОТИНЦЫ; НЕВДАЛЕКЕ, ВИДНО БЫЛО  В  НОЧИ, ЗАЖЖЕННОЕ АВИАЦИЕЙ, ЧТО-ТО ГОРЕЛО ЯРКИМ, НА ПОЛНЕБА, ПЛАМЕНЕМ -  ГОВОРИЛИ, СТАНЦИЯ. НИКТО ИМ НЕ ОБЪЯСНИЛ НИЧЕГО, ВИДНО,  КОМАНДИРЫ  ЗНАЛИ  НЕ  БОЛЬШЕ БОЙЦОВ, НО ЛЮДЯМ КАК-ТО САМО СОБОЙ ПЕРЕДАЛОСЬ, ЧТО  СОВСЕМ  БЛИЗКО  НЕНЦЫ. ВСКОРЕ КОМАНДИР  ПОЛКА  МАЙОР  ПАРАХНЕВИЧ  ПОВЕРНУЛ  КОЛОННУ  НА  БОКОВУЮ, ОБСАЖЕННУЮ ВЕРБАМИ ДОРОГУ. ПОЕХАЛИ КУДА-ТО НА ЮГ. НОЧЬЮ БЫЛО СПОКОЙНЕЕ БЕЗ АВИАЦИИ, ЗАТО ОНИ БЫЛИ СЛЕПЫ И ГЛУХИ: ЗА РЕВОМ ТРАКТОРОВ НИЧЕГО НЕВОЗМОЖНО БЫЛО УСЛЫШАТЬ, А В ЛЕТНЕЙ НОЧНОЙ ТЕМНОТЕ НЕ  МНОГО  УВИДИШЬ.  ПЕРЕД  САМЫМ РАССВЕТОМ СОТНИКОВ НЕ ВЫДЕРЖАЛ И ТОЛЬКО ЗАДРЕМАЛ НА СИДЕНЬЕ, КАК  ГРОМОВОЙ ВЗРЫВ НА ОБОЧИНЕ ВЫРВАЛ ЕГО ИЗ СНА. КОМБАТА ОБДАЛО ЗЕМЛЕЙ И ГОРЯЧЕЙ ВОЛНОЙ ВЗРЫВА, ОН ТУТ ЖЕ ВСКОЧИЛ:  КОМСОМОЛЕЦ  СИЛЬНО ОСЕЛ НА ПРАВУЮ ГУСЕНИЦУ.  И ТУТ НАЧАЛОСЬ...    КАК РАЗ СВЕТАЛО, ЗА ВЕРБАМИ ЯРКО СИНЕЛ КРАЙ НЕБА И СЕРЕЛО ОВСЯНОЕ ПОЛЕ, А ОТКУДА-ТО СПЕРЕДИ, ОТ ГОЛОВЫ КОЛОННЫ, ИХ НАЧАЛИ РАССТРЕЛИВАТЬ ТАНКИ.  НЕ УСПЕЛ СОТНИКОВ СОСКОЧИТЬ С  ТРАКТОРА,  КАК  РЯДОМ  ЗАПЫЛАЛ  ТЯГАЧ  ТРЕТЬЕЙ БАТАРЕИ,  ПРОВАЛИЛАСЬ  В  ВОРОНКУ  ГАУБИЦА.  ОГЛУШЕННЫЙ  БЛИЗКИМИ  УДАРАМИ ВЗРЫВОВ, ОН СКОМАНДОВАЛ БАТАРЕЕ РАЗВЕРНУТЬСЯ ВПРАВО И  ВЛЕВО,  НО  НЕ  ТАК ПРОСТО БЫЛО ВЫВЕРНУТЬСЯ С ГРОМОЗДКИМИ ОРУДИЯМИ  НА  УЗКОЙ  ДОРОГЕ.  ВТОРОЙ РАСЧЕТ БРОСИЛСЯ ЧЕРЕЗ КАНАВУ В  ОВЕС  И  ТУТ  ЖЕ  ПОЛУЧИЛ  ДВА  СНАРЯДА  В ТРАКТОР, ГАУБИЦА ОПРОКИНУЛАСЬ, ЗАДРАВ ВВЕРХ КОЛЕСО. УТРО ОСВЕТИЛОСЬ  ЯРКИМ ПЛАМЕНЕМ ГОРЯЩИХ ТРАКТОРОВ,  ПОСАДКИ  ЗАСТЛАЛО  СОЛЯРОВЫМ  ДЫМОМ  -  ТАНКИ РАССТРЕЛИВАЛИ ПОЛК НА ДОРОГЕ.    ЭТО БЫЛО НАИХУДШЕЕ, ЧТО МОГЛО СЛУЧИТЬСЯ,  -  ОНИ  ПОГИБАЛИ,  А  ВСЯ  ИХ ОГНЕВАЯ МОЩЬ ОСТАВАЛАСЬ ПОЧТИ НЕИСПОЛЬЗОВАННОЙ.  ПОНЯВ,  ЧТО  ИМ  ОТВЕДЕНО НЕСКОЛЬКО СКУПЫХ СЕКУНД, СОТНИКОВ С РАСЧЕТОМ КОЕ-КАК  РАЗВЕРНУЛ  ПРЯМО  НА ДОРОГЕ ПОСЛЕДНЮЮ УЦЕЛЕВШУЮ ГАУБИЦУ  И,  НЕ  УКРЕПЛЯЯ  СТАНИН,  ЕДВА  УСПЕВ СОДРАТЬ ЧЕХОЛ СО СТВОЛА, ВЫСТРЕЛИЛ ТЯЖЕЛЫМ СНАРЯДОМ. СНАЧАЛА НЕЛЬЗЯ БЫЛО И РАЗГЛЯДЕТЬ, ГДЕ ТЕ ТАНКИ: ГОЛОВНЫЕ  В  КОЛОННЕ  МАШИНЫ  ГОРЕЛИ,  УЦЕЛЕВШИЕ БОЙЦЫ С НИХ БЕЖАЛИ НАЗАД,  ДЫМ  И  ПОКОРЕЖЕННЫЕ  ТРАКТОРА  ВПЕРЕДИ  МЕШАЛИ ПРИЦЕЛИТЬСЯ. НО ПОЛМИНУТЫ СПУСТЯ МЕЖДУ ВЕРБАМИ ОН  ВСЕ  ЖЕ  УВИДЕЛ  ПЕРВЫЙ НЕМЕЦКИЙ ТАНК, КОТОРЫЙ МЕДЛЕННО  ПОЛЗ  ЗА  КАНАВОЙ  И,  СВЕРНУВ  ОРУДИЙНЫЙ СТВОЛ, ГАХАЛ И ГАХАЛ ВЫСТРЕЛАМИ НАИСКОСОК ПО КОЛОННЕ.  СОТНИКОВ  ОТТОЛКНУЛ НАВОДЧИКА (ОРУДИЕ БЫЛО УЖЕ ЗАРЯЖЕНО), ДРОЖАЩИМИ  РУКАМИ  КОЕ-КАК  ДОВЕРНУЛ ТОЛСТЕННЫЙ ГАУБИЧНЫЙ СТВОЛ И НАКОНЕЦ ПОЙМАЛ ЭТО  ЕЩЕ  ТУСКЛОЕ  В  УТРЕННЕЙ ДЫМКЕ СТРАШИЛИЩЕ НА ПЕРЕКРЕСТИЕ ПАНОРАМЫ.    ВЫСТРЕЛ ЕГО ГРОХНУЛ ПОДОБНО УДАРУ ГРОМА, ГАУБИЦА  СИЛЬНО  СДАЛА  НАЗАД, БОЛЬНО УДАРИЛА ПАНОРАМОЙ В СКУЛУ; ВНИЗУ, ИЗ-ПОД  НЕЗАКРЕПЛЕННЫХ  СОШНИКОВ, БРЫЗНУЛО ИСКРАМИ ОТ КАМНЕЙ, ОДНА  СТАНИНА  ГЛУБОКО  ВРЕЗАЛАСЬ  СОШНИКОМ  В БРОВКУ КАНАВЫ, ВТОРАЯ ОСТАЛАСЬ НА ВЕСУ НА ДОРОГЕ.  СКВОЗЬ  ПЫЛЬ,  ПОДНЯТУЮ ВЫСТРЕЛОМ, ОН ЕЩЕ НЕ УСПЕЛ НИЧЕГО РАЗГЛЯДЕТЬ,  НО  УСЛЫШАЛ,  КАК  РАДОСТНО ЗАКРИЧАЛ НАВОДЧИК, И ПОНЯЛ, ЧТО ПОПАЛ. ОН ТУТ ЖЕ ОПЯТЬ ПРИПАЛ К ПАНОРАМЕ - ЕДВА НЕ ЗАКРЫВАЯ СОБОЙ ВСЕ ЕЕ ПОЛЕ  ЗРЕНИЯ,  ЗА  ДОРОГОЙ  ДВИГАЛСЯ  ВТОРОЙ ТАНК, КОМБАТ ВПЕРИЛ ГАУБИЧНЫЙ СТВОЛ В ЕГО СЕРОЕ ЛБИЩЕ  -  ТАК  БЛИЗКО  ТОТ КАЗАЛСЯ В ОПТИКЕ - И  КРИКНУЛ:   ОГОНЬ!   ЗАМКОВЫЙ  ОТРЕАГИРОВАЛ  ВОВРЕМЯ, ВЫСТРЕЛ ОПЯТЬ ОГЛУШИЛ ЕГО, НО В ЭТОТ РАЗ ОН УСПЕЛ УКЛОНИТЬСЯ ОТ ПАНОРАМЫ И ЗА ПЫЛЬЮ ПЕРЕД СТВОЛОМ УВИДЕЛ, КАК ТО, ЧТО ЗА  СЕКУНДУ  ДО  ВЫСТРЕЛА  БЫЛО ТАНКОМ, ХРЯСТНУЛО, БУДТО ЯИЧНАЯ СКОРЛУПА, И ОТ МОЩНОГО ВНУТРЕННЕГО  ВЗРЫВА ЧАСТЯМИ РАЗВАЛИЛОСЬ В СТОРОНЫ.  НЕПОВОРОТЛИВАЯ,  ТЯЖЕЛАЯ,  ПРЕДНАЗНАЧЕННАЯ ДЛЯ СТРЕЛЬБЫ ИЗ ДАЛЕКОГО ТЫЛА ГАУБИЦА СВОИМ МОЩНЫМ СНАРЯДОМ РАЗНЕСЛА  ТАНК ВДРЕБЕЗГИ.    НЕОЖИДАННО ИХ ОХВАТИЛ АЗАРТ БОЕВОЙ УДАЧИ. УЖЕ НЕ  ОБРАЩАЯ  ВНИМАНИЯ  НА ПОТЕРИ, НА УБИТЫХ И РАНЕНЫХ, ЧТО, ИСТЕКАЯ  КРОВЬЮ,  КОРЧИЛИСЬ  НА  ПЫЛЬНОМ БУЛЫЖНИКЕ, НА ОГОНЬ, ПОЖИРАВШИЙ ИХ ТЕХНИКУ, И ГРАД ПУЛЬ ОТТУДА, ИЗ ТАНКОВ, НЕСКОЛЬКО УЦЕЛЕВШИХ РАСЧЕТОВ  ВСТУПИЛИ  В  НЕРАВНЫЙ  БОЙ  С  ТАНКАМИ.  ТЕМ ВРЕМЕНЕМ РАССВЕЛО, УЖЕ СТАЛО  ВИДАТЬ,  КУДА  ЦЕЛИТЬСЯ.  НЕСКОЛЬКО  ПОЖАРОВ ДЫМНО ПЫЛАЛИ ЗА ДОРОГОЙ: НЕМЕЦКИЕ МАШИНЫ ГОРЕЛИ.    СОТНИКОВ ВЫПУСТИЛ ШЕСТЬ ТЯЖЕЛЫХ СНАРЯДОВ И  РАЗНЕС  ВДРЕБЕЗГИ  ЕЩЕ  ДВА ТАНКА.  НО  КАКОЕ-ТО  ПОДСОЗНАТЕЛЬНОЕ,  ОБОСТРЕННОЕ   ОПАСНОСТЬЮ   ЧУВСТВО ПОДСКАЗАЛО ЕМУ, ЧТО УДАЧА КОНЧАЕТСЯ, ЧТО СУДЬБОЙ  ИЛИ  СЛУЧАЕМ  ОТПУЩЕННЫЕ СЕКУНДЫ ИСПОЛЬЗОВАНЫ ИМ ПОЛНОСТЬЮ, ЧТО СЛЕДУЮЩИЙ, ВТОРОЙ ИЛИ ТРЕТИЙ СНАРЯД ИЗ ТАНКА БУДЕТ ЕГО. ВПЕРЕДИ ЖИВЫХ, НАВЕРНОЕ, УЖЕ  НЕ  ОСТАЛОСЬ,  ПОСЛЕДНИМ ПРИТАЩИЛСЯ ОТТУДА И УПАЛ, ОБЛИВАЯ КРОВЬЮ СТАНИНУ, КОМАНДИР ПОЛКА; РЯДОМ  В КАНАВЕ БАХАЛИ ИЗ КАРАБИНОВ НЕСКОЛЬКО БОЙЦОВ  -  МЕТИЛИ  В  ТАНКОВЫЕ  ЩЕЛИ. ВОЗЛЕ ЯЩИКОВ УТКНУЛСЯ ГОЛОВОЙ В ЗЕМЛЮ ЗАРЯЖАЮЩИЙ  КОГОТКОВ,  СЗАДИ  НИКОГО БОЛЬШЕ НЕ БЫЛО. ТОГДА СОТНИКОВ НА ЧЕТВЕРЕНЬКАХ САМ БРОСИЛСЯ  К  СНАРЯДНОМУ ЯЩИКУ. ОДНАКО ОН НЕ УСПЕЛ ДОПОЛЗТИ ДО НЕГО, КАК СЗАДИ ОГЛУШАЮЩЕ  ГРОХНУЛО, ТУГАЯ ВОЛНА ВЗРЫВА  РАСПЛАСТАЛА  ЕГО  НА  БУЛЫЖНИКЕ,  И  ЧЕРНОЕ  УДУШЛИВОЕ ПОКРЫВАЛО НА НЕСКОЛЬКО ДОЛГИХ СЕКУНД ЗАКРЫЛО СОБОЙ ДОРОГУ. ЗАДОХНУВШИСЬ ОТ ЗЕМЛИ И ПЫЛИ, ОН КРАЕШКОМ СОЗНАНИЯ ВСЕ ЖЕ ПОЧУВСТВОВАЛ, ЧТО ЖИВ, И ТУТ  ЖЕ ПОД ЛАВОЙ ЗЕМЛЯНОЙ ТРУХИ, КОТОРАЯ НИЗРИНУЛАСЬ СВЕРХУ, РВАНУЛСЯ  К  ОРУДИЮ. НО ГАУБИЦА УЖЕ  НЕМОЩНО  СКОСОБОЧИЛАСЬ  НА  КРАЮ  ВОРОНКИ,  СТВОЛ  ВЗРЫВОМ СВЕРНУЛО В СТОРОНУ, СМРАДНО ГОРЕЛА РЕЗИНА  КОЛЕСНОГО  ОБОДА.  И  ТОГДА  ОН ПОНЯЛ, ЧТО ЭТО КОНЕЦ. ОН ПЛОХО ЕЩЕ  СООБРАЖАЛ,  САМ  УЦЕЛЕЛ  ИЛИ  НЕТ,  НО ЧУВСТВОВАЛ, ЧТО ОГЛОХ: ВЗРЫВЫ ВОКРУГ УШЛИ ЗА НЕПРОНИЦАЕМУЮ ТОЛСТУЮ  СТЕНУ, ДРУГИЕ ЗВУКИ ВСЕ РАЗОМ ИСЧЕЗЛИ, В ГОЛОВЕ СТОЯЛ ПРОТЯЖНЫЙ БОЛЕЗНЕННЫЙ ЗВОН. ИЗ НОСА ПОКАЗАЛАСЬ КРОВЬ, ОН ГРЯЗНО РАЗМАЗАЛ ЕЕ ПО ЛИЦУ И СПОЛЗ С ДОРОГИ В КАНАВУ. НАПРОТИВ, ЗА ВЕРБАМИ,  ТЯЖЕЛО  ПЕРЕВАЛИВАЯСЬ  НА  ГУСЕНИЦАХ,  ШЕЛ, НАВЕРНО, ТОТ САМЫЙ, ПОДБИВШИЙ ЕГО ТАНК. СВЕЖИЙ УТРЕННИЙ ВЕТЕР СТЛАЛ ЧЕРНЫЕ КОСМЫ ДЫМА ОТ ПЫЛАЮЩЕГО ТРАКТОРА, ЖИРНО  ВОНЯЛО  СОЛЯРКОЙ  И  ТРОТИЛОМ  ОТ ВЗРЫВОВ, ДЫМНО ТЛЕЛА ГИМНАСТЕРКА НА ПЛЕЧЕ УЖЕ НЕЖИВОГО КОМАНДИРА ПОЛКА.    ПОТРЯСЕННЫЙ НЕОЖИДАННОСТЬЮ РАЗГРОМА СОТНИКОВ МИНУТУ  ОСОЛОВЕЛО  СМОТРЕЛ НА ПОЛЗУЩИЕ ЗА ДОРОГОЙ НЕМЕЦКИЕ ТАНКИ, ИХ НОМЕРА И ЧЕРНО-БЕЛЫЕ, ВЫБИТЫЕ ПО ТРАФАРЕТУ КРЕСТЫ. И ТОГДА КТО-ТО ДЕРНУЛ ЕГО ЗА РУКАВ, ОН ПОВЕРНУЛ ГОЛОВУ - РЯДОМ ПОЯВИЛОСЬ ЗАПАЧКАННОЕ САЖЕЙ И КРОВЬЮ ЛИЦО СТАРШИНЫ БАТАРЕИ,  КОТОРЫЙ ЧТО-ТО КРИЧАЛ ЕМУ И ПОКАЗЫВАЛ РУКОЙ В ТЫЛ, КУДА ПО КАНАВЕ БЕЖАЛИ БОЙЦЫ.    ОНИ ВСКОЧИЛИ И СКВОЗЬ  ВОНЮЧИЙ  ДЫМ  НАД  ДОРОГОЙ,  ПРИГНУВШИСЬ,  ТАКЖЕ ПОБЕЖАЛИ ТУДА...    	•	3     РЫБАК  ОБОШЕЛ  МЫСОК  МЕЛКОЛЕСЬЯ  И  ОСТАНОВИЛСЯ.  ВПЕРЕДИ,  НА  СКЛОНЕ ПРИГОРКА, В ЕДВА СЕРЕВШЕМ ПРОСТРАНСТВЕ  НОЧИ,  ТЕМНЕЛИ  КРАЙНИЕ  ПОСТРОЙКИ ДЕРЕВНИ. КАК ОНА ВЫГЛЯДЕЛА ОТСЮДА, РЫБАК УЖЕ НЕ ПОМНИЛ: КОГДА-ТО, В НАЧАЛЕ ОСЕНИ, ОНИ ПРОХОДИЛИ  СТОРОНОЙ  ПО  ДОРОГЕ,  НО  В  ДЕРЕВНЮ  НЕ  ЗАХОДИЛИ. ВПРОЧЕМ, СЕЙЧАС ЭТО ЕГО МАЛО ЗАБОТИЛО - ВАЖНЕЕ БЫЛО ОПРЕДЕЛИТЬ, НЕТ ЛИ ТАМ НЕМЦЕВ ИЛИ ПОЛИЦАЕВ, ЧТОБЫ НЕНАРОКОМ НЕ УГОДИТЬ В ЗАПАДНЮ.    ОН  НЕДОЛГО  ПОСТОЯЛ  ВОЗЛЕ  КУСТАРНИКА,   ПРИСЛУШИВАЯСЬ,   НО   НИЧЕГО ПОДОЗРИТЕЛЬНОГО В  ДЕРЕВНЕ  ВРОДЕ  НЕ  БЫЛО  СЛЫШНО.  ДОНЕСЛОСЬ  НЕСКОЛЬКО РАЗРОЗНЕННЫХ,  ПРИГЛУШЕННЫХ  НОЧЬЮ  ЗВУКОВ   ЛЕНИВО   ПРОТЯВКАЛА   СОБАКА. ПО-ПРЕЖНЕМУ УПРУГО И  НАСТОЙЧИВО  ДУЛ  ВЕТЕР,  ТИХО  ПОСВИСТЫВАЯ  РЯДОМ  В МЕРЗЛЫХ ВЕТВЯХ, ПАХНУЛО ДЫМОМ -  ГДЕ-ТО,  НАВЕРНО,  ТОПИЛИ.  ТЕМ  ВРЕМЕНЕМ СЗАДИ ПОДОШЕЛ СОТНИКОВ И, ОСТАНОВИВШИСЬ, ТОЖЕ ВСМОТРЕЛСЯ В СУМЕРКИ.    - НУ ЧТО?    - ВРОДЕ ТИХО, - НЕГРОМКО СКАЗАЛ РЫБАК. - ПОШЛИ ПОМАЛУ.    БЫЛО БЫ УДОБНЕЕ И КОРОЧЕ СВЕРНУТЬ К КРАЙНЕЙ В ЭТОЙ ДЕРЕВНЕ ИЗБУШКЕ, ЧТО ТЕМНЕЛА НЕВДАЛЕКЕ, ПО САМЫЕ ОКНА  УВЯЗНУВ  В  СУГРОБЕ,  -  ТАМ  НАЧИНАЛАСЬ УЛИЦА. НО ВОЗЛЕ КРАЙНЕЙ ВСЕГДА БОЛЬШИЙ РИСК НАПОРОТЬСЯ НА НЕПРИЯТНОСТЬ:  В КОНЦЕ УЛИЦЫ ОБЫЧНО ЗАКАНЧИВАЮТ СВОЙ МАРШРУТ КАРАУЛЬЩИКИ И ПАТРУЛИ, ТАМ  ЖЕ УСТРАИВАЕТ ЗАСАДЫ  ПОЛИЦИЯ.  И  ОН  СВЕРНУЛ  ПО  СНЕГУ  В  СТОРОНУ.  ВДОЛЬ ПРОВОЛОЧНОЙ  В  ДВЕ  НИТКИ  ОГРАДЫ  ОНИ  ПЕРЕШЛИ  ЛОЩИНКУ,  НАПРАВЛЯЯСЬ  К НЕДАЛЕКИМ ПОСТРОЙКАМ, ТЕСНО СГРУДИВШИМСЯ В КОНЦЕ ОГОРОДОВ НА  ОТШИБЕ.  ЭТО БЫЛО ГУМНО. ТАМ ЕЩЕ ПОСТОЯЛИ МИНУТУ ЗА РАСТРЕСКАВШИМСЯ  УГЛОМ  ПУНЬКИ  ИЛИ ТОКА С ПРОДРАННОЙ КРЫШЕЙ,  ПРИСЛУШАЛИСЬ,  И  РЫБАК  С  ОГЛЯДКОЙ  ВЫШЕЛ  НА ПРИГУМЬЕ. ОТСЮДА БЫЛО РУКОЙ ПОДАТЬ ДО  НИЗЕНЬКОЙ,  СИРОТЛИВО  ПОКОСИВШЕЙСЯ ИЗБУШКИ ПРИ ОДНОМ САРАЙЧИКЕ, КУДА ВЕЛА УТОПТАННАЯ В СНЕГУ ТРОПИНКА.  РЫБАК СДЕЛАЛ ПО НЕЙ ДВА ШАГА, НО ТУТ ЖЕ СОСТУПИЛ В СНЕГ - НА ТРОПКЕ ПРОНЗИТЕЛЬНО ЗАСКРИПЕЛО ПОД САПОГАМИ. ЗА НИМ ПРИНЯЛ В СТОРОНУ  СОТНИКОВ,  И  ОНИ  ПОШЛИ ТАК, ПО ОБЕ СТОРОНЫ СТЕЖКИ, К ИЗБЕ.    ОНИ ЕЩЕ НЕ ДОСТИГЛИ САРАЙЧИКА, КАК ДО ИХ СЛУХА ЯВСТВЕННО ДОНЕССЯ СТУК - ВО ДВОРЕ КТО-ТО РУБИЛ ДРОВА, РУБИЛ ВРОДЕ БЫ С  НЕОХОТОЙ,  ВПОЛСИЛЫ.  РЫБАК ОБРАДОВАЛСЯ: ЕСЛИ РУБЯТ ДРОВА - ЗНАЧИТ,  В  ДЕРЕВНЕ,  НАВЕРНО,  ВСЕ  ТИХО, ЧУЖИХ НЕТ. К ТОМУ ЖЕ НЕ НАДО СТУЧАТЬ В ОКНО, ПРОСИТЬСЯ ВПУСТИТЬ - ОБО ВСЕМ МОЖНО  БУДЕТ  РАССПРОСИТЬ  ДРОВОСЕКА.  ПРАВДА,  ОН  ТУТ  ЖЕ  ПОДУМАЛ,  ЧТО НЕОСТОРОЖНОСТЬЮ МОЖНО СПУГНУТЬ ЧЕЛОВЕКА - ЗАВИДЕВ ЧУЖИХ,  ЗАПРЕТСЯ,  ТОГДА ПОПРОБУЙ ЕГО ВЫТАЩИТЬ ИЗ ИЗБЫ.  И  ОН  КАК  МОЖНО  ТИШЕ  ОБОШЕЛ  САРАЙЧИК, ПЕРЕСТУПИЛ ЧЕРЕЗ КОНЦЫ БРОШЕННЫХ НА СНЕГУ ЖЕРДЕЙ И ВЫШЕЛ ИЗ-ЗА УГЛА.    В ТЕМНОВАТО-СЕРЫХ СУМЕРКАХ ДВОРА У ОГРАДЫ КТО-ТО ВОЗИЛСЯ С ПОЛЕНОМ.  ОН НЕ СРАЗУ ПОНЯЛ, ЧТО ЭТО  ЖЕНЩИНА,  КОТОРАЯ,  ЗАСЛЫШАВ  СЗАДИ  ШАГИ,  ВДРУГ ИСПУГАННО ВСКРИКНУЛА.    - ТИХО, МАМАША! - НЕГРОМКО СКАЗАЛ РЫБАК.    РАСТЕРЯВШИСЬ, ОНА ЗАМЕРЛА ПЕРЕД НИМ - НИЗЕНЬКАЯ ПОЖИЛАЯ ТЕТКА В ГРУБОМ, ТОЛСТО ПОВЯЗАННОМ НА ГОЛОВЕ ПЛАТКЕ - И НЕ МОГЛА ВЫМОЛВИТЬ СЛОВА. РЫБАК  ИЗ ПРЕДОСТОРОЖНОСТИ ВЗГЛЯНУЛ НА ВЕДУЩУЮ В СЕНИ ДВЕРЬ, ТА БЫЛА ЗАКРЫТА, БОЛЬШЕ ВО ДВОРЕ ВРОДЕ НИКОГО НЕ БЫЛО. ВПРОЧЕМ, ОН НЕ ОЧЕНЬ И ОПАСАЛСЯ  -  ОН  УЖЕ ЗНАЛ, ЧТО В ЭТОЙ ДЕРЕВНЕ СПОКОЙНО. ПОЛИЦАИ, ПОЖАЛУЙ, ЗАСЕЛИ ЗА САМОГОН,  А НЕМЦЫ ВРЯД ЛИ ТУТ ПОЯВЛЯЛИСЬ.    - ОЙ, ГОСПОДИ БОЖЕ, И НАПУГАЛАСЬ ЖЕ! ОЙ, ГОСПОДИ...    - ЛАДНО, ХВАТИТ КРЕСТИТЬСЯ. ПОЛИЦАЕВ В ДЕРЕВНЕ МНОГО?    - А НЕТ ПОЛИЦАЕВ. БЫЛ ОДИН, ТАК В МЕСТЕЧКО ПЕРЕБРАЛСЯ. А БОЛЬШЕ НЕТ.    - ТАК, - РЫБАК ПРОШЕЛСЯ ПО ДВОРУ, ВЫГЛЯНУЛ ИЗ-ЗА УГЛА.  -  ДЕРЕВНЯ  КАК НАЗЫВАЕТСЯ?    - ЛЯСИНЫ. ЛЯСИНЫ ДЕРЕВНЯ, - ПОЛНАЯ ВНИМАНИЯ И ЕЩЕ НЕ ПРОШЕДШЕГО ИСПУГА, ОТВЕЧАЛА ТЕТКА.    ЕЕ  ТОПОР  ГЛУБОКО  СИДЕЛ  В  СУКОВАТОМ  ЕЛОВОМ  ПОЛЕНЕ,  КОТОРОЕ  ОНА, ОЧЕВИДНО, ТЩЕТНО ПЫТАЛАСЬ РАСКОЛОТЬ ПОПОЛАМ.    РЫБАК УЖЕ ПРИКИНУЛ, ЧТО НЕПЛОХО  БЫ  ТУТ  И  ОТОВАРИТЬСЯ:  ПОДХОД-ВЫХОД ХОРОШИЙ, НА ПУТИ ГУМНО, ЛЕСОК - ЕСЛИ ЧТО, ВСЕ ЭТО ПРИКРОЕТ  ИХ  ОТ  ЧУЖОГО ГЛАЗА.    - КТО ЕЩЕ ДОМА?    - ТАК ОДНА Ж Я,  -  БУДТО  УДИВИВШИСЬ  ИХ  НЕОСВЕДОМЛЕННОСТИ,  ОТВЕТИЛА ЖЕНЩИНА.    - И БОЛЬШЕ НИКОГО?    - НИКОГО. ОДНА ВОТ ЖИВУ, - ВДРУГ ПОЖАЛОВАЛАСЬ ОНА, ВСЕ НЕ СВОДЯ С  НЕГО ВЫЖИДАТЕЛЬНО-ТРЕВОЖНОГО ВЗГЛЯДА, НАВЕРНО СТАРАЛАСЬ УГАДАТЬ ТАЙНУЮ ЦЕЛЬ  ИХ НОЧНОГО ВИЗИТА.    РЫБАКА, ОДНАКО, МАЛО ТРОНУЛ ЭТОТ ЕЕ ЖАЛОСТЛИВО-ПОКОРНЫЙ  ТОН,  ЕМУ  УЖЕ БЫЛИ ЗНАКОМЫ ЭТИ НАИВНЫЕ ПОВАДКИ ДЕРЕВЕНСКИХ ТЕТОК, РАЗЖАЛОБИТЬ  ЕГО  БЫЛО ТРУДНО. ТЕПЕРЬ ОН ИЗУЧАЛ ОБСТАНОВКУ НА ДВОРЕ - УВИДЕЛ РАСКРЫТЫЕ  ВОРОТА  В САРАЙ И ЗАГЛЯНУЛ В ЕГО ГЛУХОЙ, ПОЛНЫЙ НАВОЗНОГО ЗАПАХА МРАК.    - ЧТО, ПУСТО?    - ПУСТО, - УПАВШИМ ГОЛОСОМ ПОДТВЕРДИЛА ЖЕНЩИНА, НЕ ОТХОДЯ ОТ ТОПОРА.  - ЗАБРАЛИ ВСЕ ЧИСТО.    - КТО ЗАБРАЛ?    - НУ, ИЗВЕСТНО КТО. КАК У КРАСНОАРМЕЙСКОЙ МАТЕРИ. ЧТОБ  ИМ  ПОДАВИТЬСЯ, ИРОДАМ!    ТУТ РЫБАК С МИМОЛЕТНЫМ  СОЧУВСТВИЕМ  ВЗГЛЯНУЛ  НА  ЖЕНЩИНУ  -  ЕСЛИ  ТА ПЕРЕШЛА НА ПРОКЛЯТИЯ,  ЗНАЧИТ  НЕ  ВРЕТ,  МОЖНО  ВЕРИТЬ.  И  ОН  ПРО  СЕБЯ НЕДОВОЛЬНО ЧМЫХНУЛ, ПОНЯВ, ЧТО И ЗДЕСЬ, НАВЕРНО, НИЧЕГО НЕ ВЫЙДЕТ, - НЕ ДО НИТКИ ЖЕ ОБИРАТЬ ЕЕ,  И  БЕЗ  ТОГО  ОБОБРАННУЮ  НЕМЦАМИ.  ПРИДЕТСЯ  ИСКАТЬ ДАЛЬШЕ.    СОТНИКОВ, ССУТУЛЯСЬ, УНЫЛО ОЖИДАЛ ПОД СТЕНОЙ, И РЫБАК ШАГНУЛ К ЖЕНЩИНЕ.    - ЧТО, НЕ РАСКОЛЕШЬ?    ТЕТКА ДОГАДАЛАСЬ, ЧТО ОН  ПОМОЖЕТ,  И,  ЗАМЕТНО  ОБРАДОВАВШИСЬ,  КАК-ТО СРАЗУ СБРОСИЛА С СЕБЯ ПУГЛИВУЮ НАСТОРОЖЕННОСТЬ.    - ДА ВОТ, ЛИХО НА НЕГО, ВБИЛА - НЕ ВЫДЕРУ. С ВЕЧЕРА БЬЮСЬ, НИ  ТУДА  НИ СЮДА.    - А НУ ДАЙ!    РЫБАК ЗАКИНУЛ ЗА СПИНУ КАРАБИН И ОБЕИМИ РУКАМИ ВЗЯЛСЯ ЗА ГЛАДКОЕ  СУХОЕ ТОПОРИЩЕ. ХАКНУВ, СИЛЬНО УДАРИЛ ПОЛЕНОМ О КОЛОДУ, ПОТОМ ЕЩЕ. УДАРЯЛ МЕТКО, С УДОВОЛЬСТВИЕМ, ОЩУЩАЯ СИЛУ В РУКАХ И ПРИВЫЧНУЮ С ДЕТСТВА СНОРОВКУ, КОГДА ТАК ЖЕ ВОТ ЗИМНИМИ ВЕЧЕРАМИ КОЛОЛ НА УТРО ДРОВА. ПИЛИТЬ НЕ ЛЮБИЛ, А КОЛОТЬ ВСЕГДА БЫЛ ГОТОВ С ОХОТОЙ, НАХОДЯ КАК БЫ ИЗВЕЧНОЕ  УДОВЛЕТВОРЕНИЕ  В  ЭТОЙ ТРУДНОЙ, НЕ ЛИШЕННОЙ МУЖСКОГО УДАЛЬСТВА РАБОТЕ.    НА ЧЕТВЕРТОМ УДАРЕ ТРЕЩИНА КРИВО  ОБЕЖАЛА  СУК,  И  ПОЛЕНО  РАЗВАЛИЛОСЬ НАДВОЕ. ОН РАСКОЛОЛ ЕЩЕ И ПОЛОВИНКИ.    - ОТ СПАСИБО, СЫНОК. ДАЙ ТЕБЕ БОГ  ЗДОРОВЬИЧКА,  -  БЕЗ  ТЕНИ  НЕДАВНЕЙ СКОВАННОСТИ БЛАГОДАРИЛА ТЕТКА.    - СПАСИБОМ НЕ ОТДЕЛАЕШЬСЯ, МАТЬ. ПРОДУКТЫ ИМЕЮТСЯ?    - ПРОДУКТЫ? А КАКИЕ ПРОДУКТЫ? БУЛЬБОЧКА ЕСТЬ. МЕЛКАЯ, ПРАВДА. ЕСЛИ ЧТО, ЗАХОДИТЕ, СВАРЮ ЗАТИРКИ.    - ЭТО ЧТО! НАМ С СОБОЙ НАДО. СКОТИНУ КАКУЮ.    - Э, СКОТИНУ. ГДЕ ЕЕ ВЗЯТЬ ТЕПЕРЬ...    - А ТАМ  КТО  ЖИВЕТ?  -  РЫБАК  ПОКАЗАЛ  РУКОЙ  ЧЕРЕЗ  ОГОРОД,  ГДЕ  ЗА ОСТРОВЕРХИМ ТЫНОМ БЕЛЕЛА СНЕЖНАЯ КРЫША СОСЕДНЕЙ  ПОСТРОЙКИ.  КАЖЕТСЯ,  ТАМ ТОПИЛИ: ВЕТЕР ЗАНОСИЛ ВО ДВОР ЗАПАХ ДЫМА И ЧЕГО-ТО СЪЕСТНОГО.    - А ПЕТРА КАЧАН. ОН ТЕПЕРЬ СТАРОСТОЙ ТУТ, - ПРОСТОДУШНО СООБЩИЛА ТЕТКА.    - ДА? ЗДЕШНИЙ СТАРОСТА? ТЫ СЛЫШИШЬ? -  РЫБАК  ПОВЕРНУЛСЯ  К  СОТНИКОВУ, КОТОРЫЙ, ПРИСЛОНЯСЬ К БРЕВНУ, ТЕРПЕЛИВО СТОЯЛ ПОД СТЕНОЙ.    - НУ. ПОСТАВИЛИ СТАРОСТОЙ.    - СВОЛОЧЬ, ДА?    - А НЕ СКАЗАТЬ. СВОЙ ЧЕЛОВЕК, ТУТОШНИЙ.    РЫБАК, ПОМЕДЛИВ, РЕШИЛ:    - ЛАДНО, ПОШЛИ К СТАРОСТЕ. ОН-ТО УЖ, НАВЕРНО, ПОБОГАЧЕ ТЕБЯ.    ОНИ НЕ СТАЛИ ИСКАТЬ СТЕЖКУ, ПОДЛЕЗЛИ  ПОД  ЖЕРДЬ  В  ИЗГОРОДИ,  ПЕРЕШЛИ ЗАСЫПАННЫЙ ЗОЛОЙ И КАРТОФЕЛЬНОЙ КОЖУРОЙ ОГОРОД И ЧЕРЕЗ ДЫРУ В СТАРОМ  ТЫНЕ ПРОЛЕЗЛИ ВО ДВОР СТАРОСТЫ.    ТУТ ПОРЯДКА БЫЛО ПОБОЛЬШЕ, ЧЕМ НА СОСЕДНЕМ ДВОРЕ, ВО ВСЕМ ЧУВСТВОВАЛАСЬ ЗАБОТЛИВАЯ РУКА ХОЗЯИНА. С ТРЕХ СТОРОН  ДВОР  ОБСТУПАЛИ  ПОСТРОЙКИ:  ИЗБА, САРАЙ, ЛЕГКИЙ НАВЕС; У КРЫЛЬЦА СТОЯЛИ САНИ С ОСТАТКАМИ СЕНА В РОЗВАЛЬНЯХ - ВЕРНОЕ СВИДЕТЕЛЬСТВО ТОГО, ЧТО ХОЗЯИН НАХОДИТСЯ  ДОМА.  ПОД  КРЫШЕЙ  САРАЯ ВЫСИЛСЯ ЛАДНЫЙ ШТАБЕЛЕК НАГОТОВЛЕННЫХ, НАПИЛЕННЫХ И ПОКОЛОТЫХ ДРОВ.    КОГДА ОНИ ЕЩЕ ПЕРЕХОДИЛИ ОГОРОД,  РЫБАК  ПРИМЕТИЛ  В  ЗАМЕРЗШЕМ  ОКОШКЕ ТУСКЛЫЕ ОТБЛЕСКИ СВЕТА - НАВЕРНО, ОТ КОПТИЛКИ - И ТЕПЕРЬ  УВЕРЕННО  СТУПИЛ НА СКРИПУЧИЕ ДОСКИ КРЫЛЬЦА.    ОН НЕ СТУЧАЛ - ДВЕРЬ БЫЛА НЕ ЗАПЕРТА, СПРАВИТЬСЯ С НЕЙ  ЕМУ,  СЕЛЬСКОМУ ЖИТЕЛЮ, БЫЛО ПРИВЫЧНО И ПРОСТО: ПОВЕРНУЛ НА ЧЕТВЕРТЬ ОБОРОТА  ЗАВЕРТКУ,  И ДВЕРЬ, ТИХО СКРИПНУВ, САМА РАСТВОРИЛАСЬ. ОН ПРОШЕЛ В ТЕМНЫЕ  СЕНИ,  ВДЫХАЯ ПОЛУЗАБЫТЫЕ, ГУСТО УСТОЯВШИЕСЯ КРЕСТЬЯНСКИЕ ЗАПАХИ, ОСТОРОЖНО ПОВЕЛ  РУКОЙ ПО СТЕНЕ. ПАЛЬЦЫ ЕГО НАТКНУЛИСЬ НА КАКУЮ-ТО ЗАЛУБЕНЕВШУЮ ОТ СТУЖИ  ОДЕЖДУ, ЗАТЕМ НА ДВЕРНУЮ ПЛАНКУ. НАЩУПАВ ПОДЛЕ НЕЕ ПРОКАЛЕННУЮ МОРОЗОМ ЗАВЕСУ,  ОН ЛЕГКО ОТЫСКАЛ ОДИНАКОВУЮ ВО ВСЕХ ДЕРЕВЕНСКИХ  ДОМАХ  СКОБУ.  И  ЭТА  ДВЕРЬ ОКАЗАЛАСЬ НЕЗАПЕРТОЙ, ОН ПОТЯНУЛ  ЕЕ  НА  СЕБЯ  И  ПЕРЕСТУПИЛ  ВЫСОКОВАТЫЙ ПОРОГ, ПЕРЕДАВАЯ СКОБУ В ХОЛОДНЫЕ РУКИ СОТНИКОВА.    НА ОПРОКИНУТОЙ ПОСРЕДИ СТОЛА МИСКЕ ГОРЕЛА КОПТИЛКА, ОГОНЕК ЕЕ ИСПУГАННО ВЫГНУЛСЯ ОТ КЛУБА ХОЛОДНОГО  ВОЗДУХА.  ПОЖИЛОЙ,  С  КОРОТКО  ПОДСТРИЖЕННОЙ БОРОДОЙ ЧЕЛОВЕК, СИДЕВШИЙ ЗА СТОЛОМ  В  НАБРОШЕННОМ  НА  ПЛЕЧИ  ТУЛУПЧИКЕ, ПОДНЯЛ СЕДУЮ ГОЛОВУ. НА ЕГО  ШИРОКОМ,  НЕПРИВЫЧНО  ОСВЕЩЕННОМ  СНИЗУ  ЛИЦЕ КОРОТКО БЛЕСНУЛ НЕДОВОЛЬНЫЙ ВЗГЛЯД, ТУТ ЖЕ, ОДНАКО, И ПОТУХШИЙ  ПОД  НИЗКО ОПУЩЕННЫМИ СЕДЫМИ БРОВЯМИ.    - ДОБРЫЙ ВЕЧЕР, - СО СДЕРЖАННОЙ ВЕЖЛИВОСТЬЮ ПОЗДОРОВАЛСЯ РЫБАК.    КОНЕЧНО, МОЖНО БЫ И БЕЗ ЭТОГО  ПРИВЕТСТВИЯ  НЕМЕЦКОМУ  ПРИСЛУЖНИКУ,  НО РЫБАКУ НЕ ХОТЕЛОСЬ СРАЗУ НАЧИНАТЬ НЕПРИЯТНЫЙ ДЛЯ  НЕГО  РАЗГОВОР.  СТАРИК, ОДНАКО, НЕ ОТВЕТИЛ, ДАЖЕ НЕ ПОШЕВЕЛИЛСЯ ЗА СТОЛОМ, ТОЛЬКО ЕЩЕ РАЗ, УЖЕ БЕЗ ВСЯКОГО ЛЮБОПЫТСТВА, ПОГЛЯДЕЛ НА НИХ.    СЗАДИ ВСЕ НЕСЛО ХОЛОДОМ -  СОТНИКОВ  НЕУМЕЛО  ГРОМЫХАЛ  ДВЕРЬЮ,  ТЩЕТНО СТАРАЯСЬ ЗАХЛОПНУТЬ ЕЕ. РЫБАК  ОБЕРНУЛСЯ,  С  ПРИВЫЧНЫМ  ПРИСТУКОМ  ЗАКРЫЛ ДВЕРЬ. ХОЗЯИН НАКОНЕЦ МЕДЛЕННО ВЫПРЯМИЛСЯ ЗА  СТОЛОМ,  НЕ  МЕНЯЯ,  ОДНАКО, БЕЗУЧАСТНОГО ВЫРАЖЕНИЯ НА ЛИЦЕ, БУДТО  И  НЕ  ДОГАДЫВАЛСЯ,  КТО  ОНИ,  ЭТИ НЕПРОШЕНЫЕ НОЧНЫЕ ПРИШЕЛЬЦЫ.    -  ТЫ  ЗДЕШНИЙ  СТАРОСТА?  -  ОФИЦИАЛЬНО   СПРОСИЛ   РЫБАК,   ВРАЗВАЛКУ НАПРАВЛЯЯСЬ К СТОЛУ. В ТРОФЕЙНЫХ ЕГО САПОГАХ БЫЛО СКОЛЬЗКО С МОРОЗА, И  ОН НЕВОЛЬНО СДЕРЖИВАЛ ШАГ.    СТАРИК ВЗДОХНУЛ  И,  НАВЕРНО  ПОНЯВ,  ЧТО  ПРЕДСТОИТ  РАЗГОВОР,  ЗАКРЫЛ ТОЛСТУЮ КНИГУ, КОТОРУЮ ПЕРЕД ТЕМ ЧИТАЛ У КОПТИЛКИ.    - СТАРОСТА, НУ, - СКАЗАЛ ОН РОВНЫМ, БЕЗ ТЕНИ ИСПУГА ИЛИ  ПОДОБОСТРАСТИЯ ГОЛОСОМ.    В ТО ВРЕМЯ В ЗАПЕЧЬЕ ПОСЛЫШАЛСЯ  КОРОТКИЙ  ШОРОХ,  И  ИЗ-ЗА  ЗАНАВЕСКИ, ПОПРАВЛЯЯ НА ГОЛОВЕ ПЛАТОК, ПОЯВИЛАСЬ МАЛЕНЬКАЯ,  ХУДЕНЬКАЯ  И,  ВИДНО  ПО ВСЕМУ, ОЧЕНЬ ПОДВИЖНАЯ ЖЕНЩИНА - НАВЕРНО, ХОЗЯЙКА ЭТОЙ ИЗБЫ. РЫБАК СНЯЛ  С ПЛЕЧА И ПРИСТАВИЛ К НОГАМ КАРАБИН.    - ДОГАДЫВАЕШЬСЯ, КТО МЫ?    - НЕ СЛЕПОЙ, ВИЖУ. НО ЕЖЛИ ЗА ВОДКОЙ, ТАК НЕТУ. ВСЮ ЗАБРАЛИ.    РЫБАК СО ЗНАЧЕНИЕМ ВЗГЛЯНУЛ НА СОТНИКОВА: СТАРЫЙ ПЕНЬ - НЕ ПРИНИМАЕТ ЛИ ОН ИХ ЗА ПОЛИЦАЕВ? ВПРОЧЕМ, ТАК, МОЖЕТ, И ЛУЧШЕ, ПОДУМАЛ  ОН  И,  СОХРАНЯЯ ДОБРОДУШНУЮ НЕВОЗМУТИМОСТЬ, СКАЗАЛ:    - ЧТО Ж, ОБОЙДЕМСЯ БЕЗ ВОДКИ.    СТАРОСТА ПОМОЛЧАЛ, БУДТО РАЗМЫШЛЯЯ НАД ЧЕМ-ТО, ПОДВИНУЛ НА  КРАЙ  СТОЛА МИСКУ С КОПТИЛКОЙ. НА ПОЛУ СТАЛО СВЕТЛЕЕ.    - ЕСЛИ ТАК, САДИТЕСЬ.    - АГА, САДИТЕСЬ, САДИТЕСЬ, ДЕТКИ, -  ОБРАДОВАЛАСЬ  ПРИГЛАШЕНИЮ  ХОЗЯИНА ЖЕНЩИНА. ПОДХВАТИВ ОТ СТОЛА СКАМЕЙКУ, ОНА ПОСТАВИЛА ЕЕ У ПЕЧКИ, В КОТОРОЙ, ВИДНО БЫЛО, ДОГОРАЛИ НА НОЧЬ  ДРОВА.  -  ТУТ  БУДЕТ  ТЕПЛЕЕ,  НАВЕРНО  ЖЕ, ОЗЯБЛИ. МОРОЗ ТАКОЙ...    - МОЖНО И ПРИСЕСТЬ,  -  СОГЛАСИЛСЯ  РЫБАК,  НО  САМ  НЕ  СЕЛ  -  КИВНУЛ СОТНИКОВУ: - САДИСЬ, ГРЕЙСЯ.    СОТНИКОВА НЕ НАДО БЫЛО УГОВАРИВАТЬ - ОН ТОТЧАС  ОПУСТИЛСЯ  НА  ЛАВКУ  И ПРИСЛОНИЛСЯ СПИНОЙ К ПОБЕЛЕННОМУ БОКУ ПЕЧИ. ВИНТОВКУ ДЕРЖАЛ В РУКАХ, БУДТО ОПИРАЛСЯ НА НЕЕ, ПИЛОТКУ НА ГОЛОВЕ НЕ ПОПРАВИЛ ДАЖЕ  -  КАК  БЫЛА  ГЛУБОКО НАСУНУТА НА  ПРИМОРОЖЕННЫЕ  УШИ,  ТАК  И  ОСТАЛАСЬ.  РЫБАКУ  ТЕМ  ВРЕМЕНЕМ СТАНОВИЛОСЬ ВСЕ ТЕПЛЕЕ,  ОН  РАССТЕГНУЛ  СВЕРХУ  ПОЛУШУБОК  И  СДВИНУЛ  НА ЗАТЫЛОК ШАПКУ. ХОЗЯИН ОСТАВАЛСЯ ЗА СТОЛОМ С НЕЗАВИСИМО-БЕССТРАСТНЫМ ВИДОМ, А ХОЗЯЙКА, СЛОЖИВ НА ЖИВОТЕ  РУКИ,  НАСТОРОЖЕННО  И  ТРЕПЕТНО  СЛЕДИЛА  ЗА КАЖДЫМ ИХ ДВИЖЕНИЕМ,  БОИТСЯ , - ПОДУМАЛ РЫБАК. СЛЕДУЯ СВОЕЙ  ПАРТИЗАНСКОЙ ПРИВЫЧКЕ, ОН, ПРЕЖДЕ ЧЕМ СЕСТЬ, ПРОШЕЛСЯ ПО ИЗБЕ, БУДТО НЕВЗНАЧАЙ ЗАГЛЯНУЛ В  ТЕМНЫЙ  ЗАПЕЧЕК  И  ОСТАНОВИЛСЯ   ВОЗЛЕ   КРАСНОГО   ФАНЕРНОГО   ШКАФА, ОТГОРАЖИВАВШЕГО УГОЛ С КРОВАТЬЮ. ХОЗЯЙКА УВАЖИТЕЛЬНО ОТСТУПИЛА В СТОРОНУ.    - ТАМ НИКОГО, ДЕТКИ, НИКОГО.    - ЧТО, ОДНИ ЖИВЕТЕ?    - ОДНИ. ВОТ С ДЕДОМ ТАК И КОПТИМ СВЕТ, -  С  ЗАМЕТНОЙ  ПЕЧАЛЬЮ  СКАЗАЛА ЖЕНЩИНА. И ВДРУГ НЕ ПРЕДЛОЖИЛА, А КАК БЫ ЗАПРОСИЛА ДАЖЕ: -  МОЖЕТ,  ВЫ  БЫ ПОЕЛИ ЧЕГО? ВЕРНО Ж, ГОЛОДНЫЕ, А? КОНЕЧНО, С МОРОЗА ДА БЕЗ ГОРЯЧЕГО...    РЫБАК УЛЫБНУЛСЯ И ДОВОЛЬНО ПОТЕР ОЗЯБШИЕ РУКИ.    - МОЖЕТ, И ПОЕДИМ. КАК ДУМАЕШЬ? - С ДЕЛАННОЙ НЕРЕШИТЕЛЬНОСТЬЮ ОБРАТИЛСЯ ОН К СОТНИКОВУ. - ПОДКРЕПИМСЯ, ЕСЛИ ПАНИ СТАРОСТИХА УГОЩАЕТ...    - ВОТ И  ХОРОШО.  Я  СЕЙЧАС,  -  ОБРАДОВАЛАСЬ  ЖЕНЩИНА.  -  КАПУСТОЧКА, НАВЕРНО, ТЕПЛАЯ ЕЩЕ. И ЭТО... МОЖЕТ, БУЛЬБОЧКИ СВАРИТЬ?    - НЕТ, ВАРИТЬ НЕ НАДО. НЕКОГДА, - РЕШИТЕЛЬНО ВОЗРАЗИЛ  РЫБАК  И  ИСКОСА ВЗГЛЯНУЛ НА СТАРОСТУ, КОТОРЫЙ, ОБЛОКОТЯСЬ  НА  СТОЛ,  НЕПОДВИЖНО  СИДЕЛ  В УГЛУ.    НАД НИМ, ПОВЯЗАННЫЕ ВЫШИТЫМИ ПОЛОТЕНЦАМИ, ТЕМНЕЛИ ТРИ СТАРИННЫЕ  ИКОНЫ. РЫБАК ТЯЖЕЛО ПРОТОПАЛ САПОГАМИ К ПРОСТЕНКУ  И  ОСТАНОВИЛСЯ  ПЕРЕД  БОЛЬШОЙ ЗАСТЕКЛЕННОЙ РАМОЙ С ФОТОГРАФИЯМИ. ОН УМЫШЛЕННО ИЗБЕГАЛ ПРЯМО ВЗГЛЯНУТЬ НА СТАРОСТУ, ЧУВСТВУЯ, ЧТО ТОТ САМ, НЕ ПЕРЕСТАВАЯ,  ВТИХОМОЛКУ  НАБЛЮДАЕТ  ЗА НИМ.    - ЗНАЧИТ, НЕМЦАМ СЛУЖИШЬ?    - ПРИХОДИТСЯ, - ВЗДОХНУЛ СТАРИК. - ЧТО ПОДЕЛАЕШЬ!    - И МНОГО ПЛАТЯТ?    ДЕД НЕ МОГ НЕ ПОЧУВСТВОВАТЬ ЯВНОЙ ИЗДЕВКИ В ЭТОМ  ВОПРОСЕ,  НО  ОТВЕТИЛ СПОКОЙНО, С ДОСТОИНСТВОМ:    - НЕ СПРАШИВАЛ И ЗНАТЬ НЕ ХОЧУ. СВОИМ, ОБОЙДУСЬ.     ОДНАКО! - ЗАМЕТИЛ ПРО СЕБЯ РЫБАК. - ВИДНО, С ХАРАКТЕРОМ .    В БЕРЕЗОВОЙ РАМЕ НА  СТЕНЕ  СРЕДИ  ПОЛДЮЖИНЫ  РАЗЛИЧНЫХ  ФОТОГРАФИЙ  ОН ВЫСМОТРЕЛ МОЛОДОГО, ЧЕМ-ТО НЕУЛОВИМЫМ  ПОХОЖЕГО  НА  ЭТОГО  ДЕДА  ПАРНЯ  В ГИМНАСТЕРКЕ С АРТИЛЛЕРИЙСКИМИ ЭМБЛЕМАМИ В ПЕТЛИЦАХ  И  ТРЕМЯ  ЗНАЧКАМИ  НА ГРУДИ. БЫЛО В ЕГО ВЗГЛЯДЕ ЧТО-ТО БЕЗМЯТЕЖНО-СПОКОЙНОЕ  И  В  ТО  ЖЕ  ВРЕМЯ ПО-МОЛОДОМУ НАИВНО УВЕРЕННОЕ В СЕБЕ.    - КТО ЭТО? СЫН, МОЖЕТ?    - СЫН, СЫН. ТОЛИК НАШ, - ЛАСКОВО ПОДТВЕРДИЛА ХОЗЯЙКА, ОСТАНАВЛИВАЯСЬ  И ЧЕРЕЗ ПЛЕЧО РЫБАКА ЗАГЛЯДЫВАЯ НА ФОТО.    - А ТЕПЕРЬ ГДЕ ОН? НЕ В ПОЛИЦИИ СЛУЧАЙНО?    СТАРОСТА ПОДНЯЛ НАХМУРЕННОЕ ЛИЦО.    - А НАМ ОТКУДА ЗНАТЬ? НА ФРОНТЕ БЫЛ...    - ОЙ, БОЖЕЧКА, КАК ПОШЕЛ В ТРИДЦАТЬ ДЕВЯТОМ, ТАК БОЛЬШЕ И НЕ ВИДЕЛИ.  С САМОГО ЛЕТА НИ СЛУХУ НИ ДУХУ. ХОТЯ БЫ  ЗНАТЬ:  ЖИВОЙ  ИЛИ,  МОЖЕТ,  УЖЕ  И КОСТОЧКИ СГНИЛИ... - СТАВЯ НА СТОЛ МИСКУ СО ЩАМИ, ЗАГОВОРИЛА СТАРОСТИХА.    - ТАК, ТАК, - СКАЗАЛ РЫБАК, НЕ ОТЗЫВАЯСЬ НА ЕЕ ЖАЛОСТЛИВОЕ  ПРИЧИТАНИЕ. ВЫЖДАВ, ПОКА ОНА ВЫГОВОРИТСЯ, ОН С НАЖИМОМ ОБЪЯВИЛ СТАРИКУ: - ОПОЗОРИЛ  ТЫ СЫНА!    - А ТО КАК ЖЕ! И Я Ж ЕМУ О ТОМ ТВЕРЖУ ДЕНЬ И НОЧЬ, - С ЖАРОМ ПОДХВАТИЛА ОТ ПЕЧИ ХОЗЯЙКА. - ОПОЗОРИЛ И СЫНА И ВСЕХ ЧИСТО...    ЭТО БЫЛО НЕСКОЛЬКО НЕОЖИДАННО, ТЕМ БОЛЕЕ ЧТО СТАРОСТИХА ГОВОРИЛА  ВРОДЕ БЫ С ИСКРЕННЕЙ БОЛЬЮ В ГОЛОСЕ. СТАРОСТА, ОДНАКО, НИКАК НЕ ОТОЗВАЛСЯ НА  ЕЕ СЛОВА, НЕПОДВИЖНО СИДЕЛ С ПОНИКШИМ ВИДОМ, И РЫБАКУ  ПОКАЗАЛОСЬ,  ЧТО  ЭТОТ ДЕД ПРОСТО НЕДОУМОК КАКОЙ-ТО. НО ТОЛЬКО ОН ПОДУМАЛ О ТОМ, КАК ХМУРОЕ  ЛИЦО СТАРОСТЫ НАХМУРИЛОСЬ ЕЩЕ БОЛЬШЕ.    - БУДЕТ! НЕ ТВОЕ ДЕЛО!    ЖЕНЩИНА ТОТЧАС УМОЛКЛА, ОСТАНОВИВШИСЬ НА ПОЛУСЛОВЕ, А  СТАРОСТА  ВПЕРИЛ УКОРЯЮЩИЙ ВЗГЛЯД В РЫБАКА.    - А ОН МЕНЯ НЕ ОПОЗОРИЛ? НЕМЦУ, ОТДАЛ - ЭТО НЕ ПОЗОР?    - ТАК ВЫШЛО. НЕ ЕГО В ТОМ ВИНА.    - А ЧЬЯ? МОЯ, МОЖЕТ? - СТРОГО, БЕЗ ТЕНИ СТЕСНЕНИЯ  ИЛИ  СТРАХА  СПРОСИЛ СТАРИК И МНОГОЗНАЧИТЕЛЬНО ПОСТУЧАЛ ПО СТОЛУ: - ВАША ВИНА.    - ДА-А, - НЕОПРЕДЕЛЕННО ПРОИЗНЕС РЫБАК, НЕ ПОДДЕРЖАВ  МАЛОПРИЯТНЫЙ  ДЛЯ НЕГО И НЕ ОЧЕНЬ ПРОСТОЙ РАЗГОВОР, КОТОРОМУ,  ЗНАЛ,  ПО  НЫНЕШНИМ  ВРЕМЕНАМ НЕТУ КОНЦА.    ХОЗЯЙКА РАССТЕЛИЛА КОРОТЕНЬКУЮ, НА ПОЛСТОЛА, СКАТЕРКУ, ПОСТАВИЛА  МИСКУ СО ЩАМИ, МЯСНОЙ ЗАПАХ ОТ КОТОРЫХ ВЛАСТНО ЗАГЛУШИЛ ВСЕ ЕГО ДРУГИЕ  ЧУВСТВА, КРОМЕ ВРАЗ ОБОСТРИВШЕГОСЯ ЧУВСТВА  ГОЛОДА.  РЫБАК  НЕ  ИСПЫТЫВАЛ  К  ЭТОМУ ЧЕЛОВЕКУ НИКАКОГО ПОЧТЕНИЯ, ЕГО ОБЩИЕ РАССУЖДЕНИЯ  И  ПРИЧИНЫ,  ПОЧЕМУ  ОН СТАЛ СТАРОСТОЙ, РЫБАКА НЕ ИНТЕРЕСОВАЛИ - ФАКТ СЛУЖБЫ  У  НЕМЦЕВ  ОПРЕДЕЛЯЛ ДЛЯ НЕГО ВСЕ. ТЕПЕРЬ, ОДНАКО, ОЧЕНЬ ХОТЕЛОСЬ ЕСТЬ, И РЫБАК РЕШИЛ НА  ВРЕМЯ ОТЛОЖИТЬ ДАЛЬНЕЙШЕЕ ВЫЯСНЕНИЕ ВЗАИМООТНОШЕНИЙ СТАРИКА С НЕМЦАМИ.    - СЯДЬТЕ,  ПОДКРЕПИТЕСЬ  НЕМНОЖКО.  ВОТ  ХЛЕБУШКА  ВАМ,  -  С  ЛАСКОВОЙ ПРИВЕТЛИВОСТЬЮ ПРИГЛАШАЛА ХОЗЯЙКА.    РЫБАК, НЕ СНИМАЯ ШАПКИ, ПОЛЕЗ ЗА СТОЛ.    - ДАВАЙ ПОДРУБАЕМ, - СКАЗАЛ ОН СОТНИКОВУ.    ТОТ ВЯЛО ПОВЕРТЕЛ ГОЛОВОЙ:    - ЕШЬ. Я НЕ БУДУ.    РЫБАК  ВНИМАТЕЛЬНО  ПОСМОТРЕЛ   НА   ТОВАРИЩА,   КОТОРЫЙ,   ПОКАШЛИВАЯ, ССУТУЛИЛСЯ НА СКАМЕЙКЕ.  ВРЕМЕНАМИ  ОН  ДАЖЕ  ВЗДРАГИВАЛ,  КАК  В  ОЗНОБЕ. ХОЗЯЙКА, ВИДНО МАЛО ПОНИМАЯ СОСТОЯНИЕ ГОСТЯ, УДИВИЛАСЬ:    - ПОЧЕМУ ЖЕ НЕ БУДЕТЕ? МОЖЕТ, БРЕЗГУЕТЕ НАШИМ? МОЖЕТ, ЕЩЕ ЧЕГО ДАТЬ?    - НЕТ, СПАСИБО. НИЧЕГО НЕ НАДО, -  РЕШИТЕЛЬНО  СКАЗАЛ  СОТНИКОВ,  ЗЯБКО ПРЯЧА В РУКАВА ТОНКИЕ КИСТИ РУК.    ХОЗЯЙКА ЧИСТОСЕРДЕЧНО ВСТРЕВОЖИЛАСЬ.    - БОЖЕЧКА, МОЖЕТ, НЕ ДОГОДИЛА ЧЕМ? ТАК ИЗВИНИТЕ...    РЫБАК УДОБНО УСЕЛСЯ НА ШИРОКОЙ СКАМЬЕ  ЗА  СТОЛОМ,  ЗАЖАЛ  МЕЖ  КОЛЕНЕЙ КАРАБИН И НЕ ЗАМЕТИЛ, КАК В ПОЛНОМ МОЛЧАНИИ ОПОРОЖНИЛ МИСКУ. СТАРОСТА  ВСЕ С ТЕМ ЖЕ УГРЮМЫМ ВИДОМ НЕПОДВИЖНО СИДЕЛ В УГЛУ. ХОЗЯЙКА  СТОЯЛА  НЕВДАЛЕКЕ ОТ СТОЛА С ИСКРЕННЕЙ ГОТОВНОСТЬЮ УСЛУЖИТЬ ГОСТЮ.    - ТАК, ХЛЕБУШКО Я ПРИБЕРУ. ЭТО НА ЕГО ДОЛЮ, - СКАЗАЛ  РЫБАК,  КИВНУВ  В СТОРОНУ СОТНИКОВА.    - БЕРИТЕ, БЕРИТЕ, ДЕТКИ.    СТАРОСТА, КАЗАЛОСЬ, ЧЕГО-ТО МОЛЧА ОЖИДАЛ  -  КАКОГО-НИБУДЬ  СЛОВА  ИЛИ, МОЖЕТ, НАЧАЛА РАЗГОВОРА О ДЕЛЕ. ЕГО БОЛЬШИЕ УЗЛОВАТЫЕ РУКИ СПОКОЙНО ЛЕЖАЛИ НА ЧЕРНОЙ ОБЛОЖКЕ КНИГИ. ЗАСОВЫВАЯ ОСТАТОК ХЛЕБА ЗА ПАЗУХУ, РЫБАК СКАЗАЛ С НЕОДОБРЕНИЕМ:    - КНИЖКИ ПОЧИТЫВАЕШЬ?    - ЧТО Ж, ПОЧИТАТЬ НИКОГДА НЕ ВРЕДИТ.    - СОВЕТСКАЯ ИЛИ НЕМЕЦКАЯ?    - БИБЛИЯ.    - А НУ, А НУ! ПЕРВЫЙ РАЗ ВИЖУ БИБЛИЮ.    ПОДВИНУВШИСЬ ЗА  СТОЛОМ,  РЫБАК  С  ЛЮБОПЫТСТВОМ  ВЗЯЛ  В  РУКИ  КНИГУ, ОТВЕРНУЛ ОБЛОЖКУ. ТУТ ЖЕ ОН, ОДНАКО, ПОЧУВСТВОВАЛ, ЧТО НЕ НАДО БЫЛО ДЕЛАТЬ ЭТОГО - ОБНАРУЖИВАТЬ СВОЕГО ИНТЕРЕСА К  ЭТОЙ  ЧУЖОЙ,  МОЖЕТ,  ЕЩЕ  НЕМЦАМИ ИЗДАННОЙ КНИГЕ.    - И НАПРАСНО. НЕ МЕШАЛО БЫ И ПОЧИТАТЬ, - ПРОВОРЧАЛ СТАРОСТА.    РЫБАК РЕШИТЕЛЬНО ЗАХЛОПНУЛ БИБЛИЮ.    - НУ, ЭТО НЕ ТВОЕ ДЕЛО. НЕ ТЕБЕ НАС УЧИТЬ. ТЫ НЕМЦАМ  СЛУЖИШЬ,  ПОЭТОМУ НАМ ВРАГ, - СКАЗАЛ  РЫБАК,  ОЩУЩАЯ  ТАЙНОЕ  УДОВЛЕТВОРЕНИЕ  ОТ  ТОГО,  ЧТО ПОДВЕРНУЛСЯ ПОВОД ОБОЙТИСЬ БЕЗ БЛАГОДАРНОСТИ ЗА УГОЩЕНИЕ  И  ПЕРЕКЛЮЧИТЬСЯ НА БОЛЕЕ ОТВЕЧАВШИЙ ОБСТАНОВКЕ ТОН. ОН ВЫЛЕЗ ИЗ-ЗА СТОЛА НА СЕРЕДИНУ ИЗБЫ, ПОПРАВИЛ НА ПОЛУШУБКЕ  НЕСКОЛЬКО  ТУГОВАТЫЙ  ТЕПЕРЬ  РЕМЕНЬ.  ИМЕННО  ЭТОТ ПОВОРОТ В ИХ ОТНОШЕНИЯХ ДАВАЛ ЕМУ ВОЗМОЖНОСТЬ ПЕРЕЙТИ БЛИЖЕ К  ДЕЛУ,  ХОТЯ САМ ПО СЕБЕ ПЕРЕХОД И НУЖДАЛСЯ ЕЩЕ В НЕКОТОРОЙ ПОДГОТОВКЕ. - ТЫ ВРАГ. А  С ВРАГАМИ У НАС ЗНАЕШЬ КАКОЙ РАЗГОВОР?    - СМОТРЯ КОМУ ВРАГ, -  БУДТО  НЕ  ПОДОЗРЕВАЯ  ВСЕЙ  СЕРЬЕЗНОСТИ  СВОЕГО ПОЛОЖЕНИЯ, ТИХО, НО ТВЕРДО ВОЗРАЗИЛ СТАРИК.    - СВОИМ. РУССКИМ.    - СВОИМ Я НЕ ВРАГ.    СТАРОСТА УПРЯМО НЕ СОГЛАШАЛСЯ, И ЭТО НАЧИНАЛО ЗЛИТЬ РЫБАКА. НЕ  ХВАТАЛО ЕЩЕ ДОКАЗЫВАТЬ ЭТОМУ ПРИСЛУЖНИКУ, ПОЧЕМУ ТОТ, ХОЧЕТ ТОГО ИЛИ НЕТ, ЯВЛЯЕТСЯ ВРАГОМ СОВЕТСКОЙ ДЕРЖАВЫ. ЗАВОДИТЬ ДОЛГИЙ РАЗГОВОР С  НИМ  РЫБАК  НЕ  ИМЕЛ НИКАКОГО ЖЕЛАНИЯ И СПРОСИЛ С ПЛОХО СКРЫТОЙ ИЗДЕВКОЙ:    - ЧТО, МОЖЕТ, СИЛОЙ ЗАСТАВИЛИ? ПРОТИВ ВОЛИ?    - НЕТ, ЗАЧЕМ ЖЕ СИЛОЙ, - СКАЗАЛ ХОЗЯИН.    - ЗНАЧИТ, САМ.    - КАК СКАЗАТЬ. ВРОДЕ ТАК.     ТОГДА ВСЕ ЯСНО,  -  ПОДУМАЛ  РЫБАК,  -  НЕ  О  ЧЕМ  И  РАЗГОВАРИВАТЬ . НЕПРИЯЗНЬ К ЭТОМУ ЧЕЛОВЕКУ В НЕМ ВСЕ НАРАСТАЛА, ОН УЖЕ ПОЖАЛЕЛ О  ВРЕМЕНИ, ПОТРАЧЕННОМ НА ПУСТОЙ РАЗГОВОР, ТОГДА КАК С САМОГО НАЧАЛА ВСЕ БЫЛО ЯСНО.    - ТАК! ПОШЛИ! - ЖЕСТКО ПРИКАЗАЛ ОН.    ВСКИНУВ РУКИ, К РЫБАКУ БРОСИЛАСЬ СТАРОСТИХА.    - ОЙ, СЫНОЧЕК, КУДА ЖЕ ТЫ? НЕ  НАДО,  ПОЖАЛЕЙ  ДУРАКА.  СТАРИК  ОН,  ПО ГЛУПОСТИ СВОЕЙ...    СТАРОСТА,  ОДНАКО,  НЕ  ЗАСТАВИЛ  ПОВТОРЯТЬ   ПРИКАЗ   И   С   ЗАВИДНЫМ САМООБЛАДАНИЕМ НЕТОРОПЛИВО ПОДНЯЛСЯ ЗА СТОЛОМ, НАДЕЛ В РУКАВА  ТУЛУП.  БЫЛ ОН СОВСЕМ СЕДОЙ И, НЕСМОТРЯ НА ГОДЫ, БОЛЬШОЙ И ПЛЕЧИСТЫЙ - ВСТАВ, ЗАСЛОНИЛ СОБОЙ ВЕСЬ УГОЛ С ИКОНАМИ.    - ЗАМОЛЧИ! - ПРИКАЗАЛ ОН ЖЕНЕ. - НУ!    ВИДНО, СТАРОСТИХА ПРИВЫКЛА  К  ПОСЛУШАНИЮ  -  ВСХЛИПНУЛА  НАПОСЛЕДОК  И ПОДАЛАСЬ ЗА ЗАНАВЕСКУ. СТАРОСТА  ОСТОРОЖНО,  БУДТО  БОЯСЬ  ЧТО-ТО  ЗАДЕТЬ, ВЫЛЕЗ ИЗ-ЗА СТОЛА.    - НУ ЧТО Ж, ВОЛЯ ВАША. БЕЙТЕ! НЕ ВЫ, ТАК ДРУГИЕ.    ВОН, - ОН КОРОТКО КИВНУЛ НА ПРОСТЕНОК, - СТАВИЛИ УЖЕ, СТРЕЛЯЛИ.    РЫБАК НЕВОЛЬНО ВЗГЛЯНУЛ, КУДА УКАЗЫВАЛ ХОЗЯИН; ДЕЙСТВИТЕЛЬНО, НА  БЕЛОЙ СТЕНЕ У ОКНА ЧЕРНЕЛО НЕСКОЛЬКО ДЫР - ПОХОЖЕ, ОТ ПУЛЬ.    - КТО СТРЕЛЯЛ?    ГОТОВЫЙ КО ВСЕМУ, ХОЗЯИН НЕПОДВИЖНО СТОЯЛ НА СЕРЕДИНЕ ИЗБЫ.    - А ТАКИЕ, КАК ВЫ. ВОДКИ ТРЕБОВАЛИ.    РЫБАК ВНУТРЕННЕ ПЕРЕДЕРНУЛСЯ: ОН НЕ ХОТЕЛ  УПОДОБЛЯТЬСЯ  КОМУ-ТО.  СВОИ НАМЕРЕНИЯ ОН СЧИТАЛ СПРАВЕДЛИВЫМИ, НО, ОБНАРУЖИВ ЧЬИ-ТО, ПОХОЖИЕ НА  СВОИ, ВОСПРИНИМАЛ СОБСТВЕННЫЕ УЖЕ В НЕСКОЛЬКО ДРУГОМ СВЕТЕ. И В ТО ЖЕ  ВРЕМЯ  НЕ ВЕРИЛОСЬ, ЧТОБЫ СТАРОСТА ЕГО ОБМАНЫВАЛ - ТАКИМ  ТОНОМ  НЕ  ВРУТ.  ТИХОНЬКО ВСХЛИПЫВАЯ,  ИЗ-ЗА  ЗАНАВЕСКИ   ВЫГЛЯДЫВАЛА   СТАРОСТИХА.   НА   СКАМЕЙКЕ, СГОРБИВШИСЬ, КАШЛЯЛ СОТНИКОВ, НО ОН НИ ОДНИМ  СЛОВОМ  НЕ  ВМЕШАЛСЯ  В  ЕГО РАЗГОВОР С ХОЗЯИНОМ - КАЖЕТСЯ, НАПАРНИКУ БЫЛО НЕ ДО ТОГО.    - ТАК. КОРОВА ЕСТЬ?    - ЕСТЬ. ПОКА ЧТО,  -  БЕЗО  ВСЯКОГО  ИНТЕРЕСА  К  НОВОМУ  ОБОРОТУ  ДЕЛА ОТРЕШЕННО ОТВЕТИЛ СТАРОСТА.    СТАРОСТИХА ПЕРЕСТАЛА ВСХЛИПЫВАТЬ И ЗАТИХЛА, ПРИСЛУШИВАЯСЬ К  РАЗГОВОРУ. РЫБАК РАЗДУМЫВАЛ: БЫЛО ВЕСЬМА СОБЛАЗНИТЕЛЬНО ПРИГНАТЬ В  ЛЕС  КОРОВУ,  НО, ПОЖАЛУЙ, ОТСЮДА БУДЕТ ДАЛЕКО, МОЖНО НЕ УСПЕТЬ ДО УТРА.    - ТАК, ПОШЛИ!    ОН ЗАКИНУЛ ЗА ПЛЕЧО КАРАБИН, СТАРОСТА ПОКОРНО  НАДЕЛ  СНЯТУЮ  С  ГВОЗДЯ ШАПКУ И МОЛЧА РАСПАХНУЛ ДВЕРЬ. НАПРАВЛЯЯСЬ ЗА НИМ, РЫБАК КИВНУЛ СОТНИКОВУ:    - ТЫ ПОДОЖДИ.    	•	4     КАК ТОЛЬКО ДВЕРЬ ЗА НИМ ЗАТВОРИЛАСЬ, ХОЗЯЙКА БРОСИЛАСЬ К ПОРОГУ.    - ОЙ, БОЖЕЧКА! КУДА ЖЕ ОН ЕГО? ОЙ, ЗА ЧТО ЖЕ ОН? ОЙ, ГОСПОДИ!    - НАЗАД! - ХРИПЛО ВЫДАВИЛ СОТНИКОВ И, НЕ ПОДНИМАЯСЬ СО СКАМЬИ,  ВЫТЯНУЛ НОГУ, ПРЕГРАЖДАЯ ПУТЬ К ДВЕРИ.    ЖЕНЩИНА  ИСПУГАННО  ОСТАНОВИЛАСЬ.  ОНА  ТО  ВСХЛИПЫВАЛА,  ТО  СМОЛКАЛА, НАПРЯЖЕННО ПРИСЛУШИВАЯСЬ К  ЗВУКАМ  ИЗВНЕ.  СОТНИКОВ  ПЛОХО  УЛОВИЛ  СМЫСЛ НЕДАВНЕГО ЗДЕСЬ РАЗГОВОРА, НО ТО, ЧТО ДОШЛО ДО ЕГО ЗАТУМАНЕННОГО  ГОРЯЧКОЙ СОЗНАНИЯ,  ДАВАЛО  ОСНОВАНИЕ  ДУМАТЬ,  ЧТО  РЫБАК,  НАВЕРНОЕ,   ПРИСТРЕЛИТ СТАРОСТУ.    НО ШЛО ВРЕМЯ, А ВЫСТРЕЛА НЕ БЫЛО. ЗАКРЫВАЯ РОТ УГОЛКОМ ПЛАТКА,  ЖЕНЩИНА ВСЕ ОХАЛА И ПРИЧИТАЛА, А СОТНИКОВ СИДЕЛ НА СКАМЬЕ И СТЕРЕГ, ЧТОБЫ  ОНА  НЕ ВЫСКОЧИЛА ВО ДВОР - НЕ ПОДНЯЛА БЫ КРИК. ЧУВСТВОВАЛ ОН СЕБЯ ПЛОХО.  ДОНИМАЛ КАШЕЛЬ, ОЧЕНЬ БОЛЕЛА ГОЛОВА, ВОЗЛЕ ГОРЯЧЕЙ ПЕЧИ ЕГО БРОСАЛО ТО В ЖАР, ТО В ХОЛОД.    - СЫНОК, ДАЙ ЖЕ Я ВЫЙДУ! ДАЙ ГЛЯНУ, ЧТО ОНИ ТАМ...    - НЕЧЕГО ГЛЯДЕТЬ.    ЖЕНЩИНА СЛЕПО КИДАЛАСЬ В ПОЛУМРАКЕ ИЗБЫ, ВСЕ ПРИЧИТАЯ,  НАВЕРНО,  ЧТОБЫ РАЗЖАЛОБИТЬ ЕГО Я ПРОРВАТЬСЯ К ДВЕРИ. НО НИЧЕГО НЕ ВЫЙДЕТ, ОН НЕ ПОДДАСТСЯ НА ЭТИ ЕЕ ПРИЧИТАНИЯ. ОН  ОЧЕНЬ  ХОРОШО  ПОМНИЛ,  КАК  ПРОШЛЫМ  ЛЕТОМ  ЕГО ЧРЕЗМЕРНАЯ ДОВЕРЧИВОСТЬ К ТАКОЙ ЖЕ ВОТ ТЕТКЕ ЕДВА НЕ СТОИЛА ЕМУ  ЖИЗНИ.  И ТА С ВИДУ ТОЖЕ САМА ПРОСТОТА, С БЛАГООБРАЗНЫМ ЛИЦОМ, В БЕЛОМ  ПЛАТОЧКЕ  НА ГОЛОВЕ.    ВЫЙДЯ ИЗ ЛЕСКА, ОН СРАЗУ ЗАМЕТИЛ ЕЕ СРЕДИ СВЕКОЛЬНОЙ БОТВЫ НА ОГОРОДЕ И ПОДУМАЛ: ВОТ ХОРОШО! ОНА УКАЖЕТ, КАК ПОПАСТЬ НА ТРОПУ ЧЕРЕЗ БОЛОТО  ЧЕРНЫЕ ВЫГОРЫ, КОТОРОЕ, КАК СКАЗАЛИ  ЕМУ  ВЧЕРА,  МОЖНО  ПЕРЕЙТИ,  ЛИШЬ  РАЗЫСКАВ ЕДИНСТВЕННУЮ ТРОПКУ, БЕРУЩУЮ НАЧАЛО ВОТ ОТ ЭТОЙ ДЕРЕВНИ.    ОН ВЫБРАЛСЯ ИЗ МОКРОГО КУСТАРНИКА И ВДОЛЬ ПОЛОСКИ РОСЛОЙ КОНОПЛИ, НИКЕМ НЕ  ЗАМЕЧЕННЫЙ,  БЛИЗКО  ПОДОШЕЛ  К  НЕЙ,  СОСРЕДОТОЧЕННО  КОЛУПАВШЕЙСЯ  В ГРЯДКАХ. ДО СИХ ПОР ЕГО ГЛАЗАМ ВИДИТСЯ ЕЕ ПОДОТКНУТАЯ ТЕМНАЯ ЮБКА,  БЕЛЫЕ, НЕЗАГОРЕВШИЕ ИКРЫ НОГ И КАКАЯ-ТО ПОНОШЕННАЯ КУРТКА С ЗАПЛАТКОЮ  НА  ПЛЕЧЕ. ЖЕНЩИНА ЛОМАЛА БОТВУ И НЕ СРАЗУ УВИДЕЛА ЕГО. ОН СДЕРЖАННО ПОЗДОРОВАЛСЯ,  И ОНА, К УДИВЛЕНИЮ, НЕ ИСПУГАЛАСЬ,  ТОЛЬКО  ПРИСТАЛЬНО  ВГЛЯДЕЛАСЬ  В  НЕГО, СЛУШАЯ И БУДТО НЕ ПОНИМАЯ ЕГО ТАКОЙ ПРОСТОЙ ПРОСЬБЫ.    ПОТОМ ОНА ВСЕ ОЧЕНЬ ТОЛКОВО ОБЪЯСНИЛА - И КАК  ПОПАСТЬ  НА  ТРОПИНКУ  И ПЕРЕЙТИ КЛАДКИ, И ПО КАКУЮ РУКУ ОСТАВИТЬ ХВОЙНЫЙ ГРУДОК, ЧТОБЫ НЕ  УГОДИТЬ В ТРЯСИНУ. ОН ПОБЛАГОДАРИЛ И ХОТЕЛ УЖЕ ИДТИ ДАЛЬШЕ, КАК ОНА,  ОГЛЯНУВШИСЬ, СКАЗАЛА:  ПОГОДИ, НАВЕРНОЕ ЖЕ, ГОЛОДНЫЙ ,  -  ТОРОПЛИВО  СЛОЖИЛА  В  ПОДОЛ БОТВУ И ПОВЕЛА ЕГО ПО МЕЖЕ НА УСАДЬБУ. И НАДО ЖЕ БЫЛО ЕМУ СОГЛАСИТЬСЯ!  НО ОН И В САМОМ ДЕЛЕ, КАК ВЕСЕННИЙ ВОЛК, БЫЛ ВЫМОРЕН ГОЛОДОМ И ПОКОРНО  ПОШЕЛ ЗА НЕЙ, РАДОСТНО ПРЕДВКУШАЯ СЫТНЫЙ ДЕРЕВЕНСКИЙ ЗАВТРАК.    ПОКА ОНИ ШЛИ, ОНА ТАК ЖЕ ЛАСКОВО  ОБРАЩАЛАСЬ  К  НЕМУ   СЫНОК   И  ЕЩЕ, ПОМНИЛ, РАЗА ДВА НАЗВАЛА ЕГО   ГОРОТНИЧКОМ   -  БЫЛ  ОН  НЕБРИТЫЙ,  КАК  И СЕЙЧАС, НЕУМЫТЫЙ, МОКРЫЙ ПО КОЛЕНИ ОТ РОСЫ И ВООБЩЕ ВЕСЬМА ЖАЛКИЙ НА  ВИД. РАЗГОВАРИВАТЬ ПО-ЗДЕШНЕМУ ТОЖЕ  НЕ  УМЕЛ  И  СКРЫТЬ  СВОЕ  ЯВНО  АРМЕЙСКОЕ ПРОИСХОЖДЕНИЕ НЕ МОГ - СРАЗУ БЫЛО ВИДАТЬ, КТО ОН И  ОТКУДА.  ОРУЖИЯ  В  ТО ВРЕМЯ У НЕГО НИКАКОГО НЕ БЫЛО  -  ЛИШЬ  НАКАНУНЕ  ЧУДОМ  УДАЛОСЬ  ИЗБЕЖАТЬ СМЕРТИ, КОГДА УЖЕ НЕ ОСТАВАЛОСЬ МАЛЕЙШЕЙ НАДЕЖДЫ СПАСТИСЬ...    СТАРОСТИХА ТЕМ ВРЕМЕНЕМ ВСЕ НЕ МОГЛА УСПОКОИТЬСЯ, МЕТАЛАСЬ  ПО  ИЗБЕ  И ПЛАКАЛА.    - СЫНОЧЕК, НУ КАК ЖЕ ЭТО? ОН ЖЕ ЕГО ЗАСТРЕЛИТ!    - НАДО БЫЛО РАНЬШЕ О ТОМ ДУМАТЬ, - ХОЛОДНО  СКАЗАЛ  СОТНИКОВ,  СТАРАЯСЬ ПРИСЛУШАТЬСЯ К ЗВУКАМ СО ДВОРА.    - А, ДЕЮЧКА, РАЗВЕ Я НЕ ГОВОРИЛА, РАЗВЕ МАЛО ПРОСИЛА! НА КАКОЕ ЖЕ  ЛИХО ЕМУ БЫЛО БРАТЬСЯ? БЫЛИ КОТОРЫЕ ПОМОЛОЖЕ. НО  ХОРОШИЕ  САМИ  НЕ  ХОТЕЛИ,  А НЕДОБРЫХ ЛЮДИ БОЯЛИСЬ.    - А ЕГО НЕ БОЯТСЯ?    - ПЕТРА? АЙ, ТАК ЕГО ЖЕ ТУТ ВСЕ ЗНАЮТ, МЫ ЖЕ ТУТ ВЕСЬ ВЕК  СВОЙ  ЖИВЕМ, НАШЕЙ ВОН РОДНИ ПОЛСЕЛА. ОН ЖЕ СТАРАЕТСЯ КО ВСЕМ ПО-ХОРОШЕМУ.    - ТАК УЖ И ПО-ХОРОШЕМУ!    - МОЖЕТ, И НЕ СОВСЕМ ТАК. МОЖЕТ, И ПРАВДА ТВОЯ, СЫНОК, - НЕ ВЫХОДИТ  КО ВСЕМ ПО-ХОРОШЕМУ. ЕГО ЖЕ ЗАСТАВЛЯЮТ: ТО ХЛЕБ СДАЙ, ТО ОДЕЖКУ КАКУЮ СОБЕРИ, ТО НА ДОРОГУ ПРИКАЗЫВАЮТ ВЫГОНЯТЬ СНЕГ ЧИСТИТЬ. А  ОН  ЖЕ  ГДЕ  ВОЗЬМЕТ  - ЛЮДЕЙ НАДО ПРИНУЖДАТЬ. СВОИХ ЖЕ ОБИРАТЬ.    - А ВЫ КАК ДУМАЛИ? НА ТО И ОККУПАНТЫ, ЧТОБ ГРАБИТЬ.    - ГРАБЯТ. А КАК ЖЕ? ЧТОБ ИХ БОГ ОГРАБИЛ! ПРИЕХАЛИ НА  МАШИНАХ,  ПОБРАЛИ СВИНЕЙ. А У НАС ТЕЛКУ ЗАБРАЛИ. ГОВОРЯТ: СЫН В КРАСНОЙ АРМИИ, ТАК ЧТОБ ВИНУ СГЛАДИТЬ ПЕРЕД ГЕРМАНИЕЙ. ЧТОБ ОНА ЯСНЫМ ОГНЕМ СГОРЕЛА, ТА ИХ ГЕРМАНИЯ!     ПРОКЛИНАЙ, НО НЕ ОЧЕНЬ Я ПОВЕРЮ ТЕБЕ ,  -  СОННО  ДУМАЛ  СОТНИКОВ,  НЕ УБИРАЯ ВЫТЯНУТОЙ НОГИ. ПОМНИТСЯ, ТА ТОЖЕ  ГОВОРИЛА  ЧТО-ТО  ПРО  ГЕРМАНИЮ, ПОКА СОБИРАЛА ЕМУ НА СТОЛ И РЕЗАЛА ХЛЕБ. НЕСКОЛЬКО РАЗ ВЫБЕГАЛА В СЕНА  ЗА САЛОМ И МОЛОКОМ В КУВШИНЕ, А ОН СИДЕЛ НА СКАМЬЕ У СТОЛА И,  ГЛОТАЯ  СЛЮНУ, ДОЖИДАЛСЯ, ДУРАК, УГОЩЕНИЯ. ПРАВДА, ОДНАЖДЫ ЕМУ ПОСЛЫШАЛОСЬ, БУДТО В СЕНЯХ КТО-ТО ТИХО ОТОЗВАЛСЯ, ПОТОМ ДОЛЕТЕЛ КОРОТЕНЬКИЙ ШЕПОТ, НО ТУТ ЖЕ ОН УЗНАЛ В НЕМ СОННЫЙ ГОЛОС РЕБЕНКА И УСПОКОИЛСЯ. ДА И  ХОЗЯЙКА  ВЕРНУЛАСЬ  В  ИЗБУ СПОКОЙНАЯ И ПО-ПРЕЖНЕМУ ЛАСКОВАЯ, НАЛИЛА ЕМУ КРУЖКУ МОЛОКА, НАРЕЗАЛА САЛА, И ЕГО, ПОМНИТСЯ, ПОЧТИ ЧТО РАСТРОГАЛА ЭТА ЕЕ ДОБРОТА. ПОТОМ ОН С ЖАДНОСТЬЮ ЕЛ ХЛЕБ С САЛОМ, ЗАПИВАЯ ЕГО МОЛОКОМ, И ТАК, НАВЕРНОЕ,  ПРОПАЛ  БЫ  НИ  ЗА ЧТО, ЕСЛИ  БЫ  КАКОЙ-ТО  ИНСТИНКТИВНЫЙ,  БЕЗ  ВИДИМОЙ  ПРИЧИНЫ,  ИСПУГ  НЕ ЗАСТАВИЛ  ЕГО  ВЗГЛЯНУТЬ  В  ЗАСЛОНЕННОЕ  ЦВЕТАМИ  ОКНО.  И  ОН  ОБМЕР   В РАСТЕРЯННОСТИ: ПО УЛИЦЕ БЫСТРО ШЛИ ДВОЕ С ВИНТОВКАМИ, НА ИХ РУКАВАХ БЕЛЕЛИ ПОВЯЗКИ, А РЯДОМ, ОБЪЯСНЯЯ ЧТО-ТО, БЕЖАЛА МАЛЕНЬКАЯ, ЛЕТ ВОСЬМИ ДЕВОЧКА.    ЖАЛЬ, У НЕГО ТОГДА ОТНЯЛСЯ ЯЗЫК И ОН  НИЧЕГО  НЕ  СКАЗАЛ  ТОЙ  ЛАСКОВОЙ ТЕТКЕ, - ОН ТОЛЬКО ОТТОЛКНУЛ ЕЕ ОТ ДВЕРИ И БЕШЕНО РВАНУЛ НА ОГОРОД,  ЧЕРЕЗ ЗАБОР НА ВЫГОН, В ОВРАГ. СЗАДИ СТРЕЛЯЛИ, КРИЧАЛИ, РУГАЛИСЬ. УЖЕ,  НАВЕРНО, В ОВРАЖКЕ ОН РАССЛЫШАЛ СРЕДИ ДРУГИХ ГОЛОСОВ КРИКЛИВЫЙ, СОВСЕМ НЕПОХОЖИЙ НА ПРЕЖНИЙ ГОЛОС ТОЙ ЖЕНЩИНЫ - ОНА ПОКАЗЫВАЛА  ПОЛИЦАЯМ,  ГДЕ  ОН  СКРЫЛСЯ  В КУСТАРНИКЕ.    А ТЕПЕРЬ ВОТ И ЭТА -  СЫНОК ,  ДЕТОЧКА ...    СТАРОСТИХА НЕ СЛЫША НИЧЕГО СТРАШНОГО СО ДВОРА,  НЕМНОГО  УСПОКОИЛАСЬ  И ПРИСЕЛА ПЕРЕД НИМ НА КОНЕЦ СКАМЬИ.    - ДЕТОЧКА, ЭТО ЖЕ НЕПРАВДА, ЧТО ОН  ПО  СВОЕЙ  ВОЛЕ.  ЕГО  ЖЕ  ТУТОШНИЕ МУЖИКИ УПРОСИЛИ. ОН, КАК ЖЕ ОН НЕ ХОТЕЛ! А ТУТ БУМАГА ИЗ РАЙОНА  ПРИШЛА  - СТАРОСТ НА СОВЕЩАНИЕ ВЫЗЫВАЛИ. А У НАС, В ЛЯСИНАХ, ЕЩЕ  НИКАКОГО  СТАРОСТЫ НЕТУ. НУ, МУЖИКИ И ГОВОРЯТ:  ИДИ ТЫ, ПЕТРО,  ТЫ  В  ПЛЕНУ  БЫЛ .  А  ОН  И ВЗАПРАВДУ В ТУ, НИКОЛАЕВСКУЮ, ДВА ГОДА В ПЛЕНУ БЫЛ, У НЕМЦА РАБОТАЛ.  ТАК, - ГОВОРЯТ, - ТЕБЕ ИХ НОРОВ ЗНАКОМ, ПОТЕРПИ КАКИХ ПАРУ МЕСЯЦЕВ,  ПОКА  НАШИ ВЕРНУТСЯ. А ТО БУДИЛУ ПОСТАВЯТ - БЕДЫ НЕ ОБЕРЕШЬСЯ . БУДИЛА ЭТОТ  ТОЖЕ  ИЗ ЛЯСИН, ПЛОХОЙ - СТРАХ. ДО ВОЙНЫ КАКИМ-ТО НАЧАЛЬНИКОМ РАБОТАЛ, ПО  ДЕРЕВНЯМ РАЗЪЕЗЖАЛ - ЕЩЕ ТОГДА ЕГО МУЖИКИ БОЯЛИСЬ. ТАК  ОН  ТЕПЕРЬ  НАШЕЛ  МЕСТО  В ПОЛИЦИИ. ВЛЕЗ КАК СВИНЬЯ В ЛУЖУ.    - ДОЖДЕТСЯ ПУЛИ.    - И ПУСТЬ, ЧЕРТ БЫ ПО НЕМ ПЛАКАЛ... ТАК ЭТО ПЕТРА, ДУРАКА, И УГОВОРИЛИ, ПОШЕЛ В МЕСТЕЧКО. НА СВОЕ ЛИХО,  НА  ГОРЮШКО  СВОЕ.  А  ТЕПЕРЬ  РАЗВЕ  ЕМУ ХОЧЕТСЯ НЕМЕЦКИМ ХОЛУЕМ БЫТЬ? КАЖДЫЙ ДЕНЬ БОЖИЙ ГРОЗЯТСЯ,  КРИЧАТ  ДА  ЕЩЕ НАГАНОМ В ЛОБ ТЫЧУТ, ТО ВОДКИ ТРЕБУЮТ, ТО ЕЩЕ ЧЕГО. ПЕРЕЖИВАЕТ ОН, НЕ  ДАЙ БОГ.    СОТНИКОВ СИДЕЛ,  ПРИГРЕВШИСЬ  ВОЗЛЕ  ПЕЧИ,  И,  МУЧИТЕЛЬНО  НАПРЯГАЯСЬ, СТАРАЛСЯ НЕ УСНУТЬ.  ПРАВДА,  БОРОТЬСЯ  С  ДРЕМОТОЙ  ЕМУ  ПОМОГАЛ  КАШЕЛЬ, КОТОРЫЙ ТО ОТСТАВАЛ НА МИНУТУ, ТО НАЧИНАЛ БИТЬ ТАК, ЧТО  КОЛОЛО  В  МОЗГУ. СТАРОСТИХУ ОН СЛУШАЛ И НЕ СЛУШАЛ, ВНИКАТЬ В  ЕЕ  ЖАЛОБЫ  У  НЕГО  НЕ  БЫЛО ОХОТЫ. ОН НЕ МОГ СОЧУВСТВОВАТЬ ЧЕЛОВЕКУ, КОТОРЫЙ СОГЛАСИЛСЯ  НА  СЛУЖБУ  У НЕМЦЕВ И ТАК ИЛИ ИНАЧЕ ИСПОЛНЯЛ ЭТУ СЛУЖБУ.  ТО,  ЧТО  У  НЕГО  НАХОДИЛИСЬ КАКИЕ-ТО К ТОМУ ОПРАВДАНИЯ, МАЛО  ТРОГАЛО  СОТНИКОВА,  УЖЕ  ЗНАВШЕГО  ЦЕНУ ТАКОГО  РОДА  ОПРАВДАНИЯМ.  В  ЖЕСТОКОЙ  БОРЬБЕ  С  ФАШИЗМОМ  НЕЛЬЗЯ  БЫЛО ПРИНИМАТЬ ВО ВНИМАНИЕ НИКАКИЕ, ДАЖЕ САМЫЕ УВАЖИТЕЛЬНЫЕ, ПРИЧИНЫ - ПОБЕДИТЬ МОЖНО БЫЛО ЛИШЬ ВОПРЕКИ ВСЕМ ПРИЧИНАМ. ОН ПОНЯЛ ЭТО С САМОГО ПЕРВОГО БОЯ И ВСЕГДА ПРИДЕРЖИВАЛСЯ ИМЕННО ЭТОГО  УБЕЖДЕНИЯ,  ЧТО,  В  СВОЮ  ОЧЕРЕДЬ,  ВО МНОГОМ ПОМОГЛО ЕМУ СОХРАНИТЬ ТВЕРДОСТЬ СВОИХ ПОЗИЦИЙ  ВО  ВСЕХ  СЛОЖНОСТЯХ ЭТОЙ ВОЙНЫ.    СПОХВАТИВШИСЬ, ЧТО ДРЕМЛЕТ, СОТНИКОВ ПОПЫТАЛСЯ ПОДНЯТЬСЯ,  НО  ЕГО  ТАК ПОВЕЛО  ПО  ИЗБЕ,  ЧТО  ОН  ЕДВА  НЕ  УДАРИЛСЯ  О  СТЕНУ.  ХОЗЯЙКА,   САМА ИСПУГАВШИСЬ, КОЕ-КАК ПОДДЕРЖАЛА ЕГО, И ОН ПОДОБРАЛ С ПОЛА ВИНТОВКУ.    - ФУ, ЧЕРТ!    - СЫНОК, ДА ЧТО ЖЕ ЭТО С ТОБОЙ? ДА ТЫ ЖЕ БОЛЬНОЙ! АХ  БОЖЕЧКА!  В  ЖАРУ ВЕСЬ! ТЕБЕ ЖЕ ЛЕЖАТЬ НАДО. ВОН КАК ХРИПИТ ВСЕ В ГРУДИ. ПОДОЖДИ, ПОСИДИ,  Я ЗЕЛЬЯ СКОРЕНЬКО ЗАВАРЮ...    ОНА С ИСКРЕННЕЙ ГОТОВНОСТЬЮ ПОМОЧЬ, ЮРКНУЛА  В  ЗАПЕЧЕК,  ЗАШУМЕЛА  ТАМ ЧЕМ-ТО. И ОН ПОДУМАЛ, ЧТО, НАВЕРНО, И ВПРЯМЬ  ЕГО  ДЕЛО  ДРЯНЬ,  ЕСЛИ  ТАК ЗАБЕСПОКОИЛАСЬ ЭТА ТЕТКА.    - НЕ БЕСПОКОЙТЕСЬ, МНЕ НИЧЕГО НЕ НАДО.    ЕМУ И В САМОМ ДЕЛЕ НЕ ХОТЕЛОСЬ УЖЕ НИ ПИТЬ, НИ ЕСТЬ И НИЧЕГО  НЕ  НУЖНО БЫЛО, КРОМЕ ТЕПЛА И ПОКОЯ.    - КАК ЖЕ НЕ НАДО, СЫНОК? ТЫ ЖЕ ХВОРЫЙ, РАЗВЕ  НЕ  ВИДНО?  Я  ДАВНО  УЖЕ ПРИМЕЧАЮ. ЕСЛИ, МОЖЕТ, НЕКОГДА,  ТО  НА  МАЛИНКИ  СУХОЙ,  МОЖЕТ,  ЗАВАРИШЬ ГДЕ-ЛИБО, ПОПЬЕШЬ. А ЭТО ВОТ ЗЕЛЬЕЧКО...    - НИЧЕГО НЕ НАДО.    ОНА СОВАЛА ЕМУ ЧТО-ТО ИЗ МЕШОЧКОВ, КОТОРЫЕ ДОСТАЛА  С  ПЕЧИ,  А  ОН  НЕ ХОТЕЛ НИЧЕГО БРАТЬ. ОН НЕ ЖЕЛАЛ  ЭТОЙ  ТЕТКЕ  ХОРОШЕГО  И  ПОТОМУ  НЕ  МОГ СОГЛАСИТЬСЯ НА ЕЕ СОЧУВСТВИЕ И ЕЕ ПОМОЩЬ. В ЭТО ВРЕМЯ В  СЕНЯХ  ЗАСТУЧАЛИ, ПОСЛЫШАЛСЯ ГОЛОС РЫБАКА, И В ИЗБУ ЗАГЛЯНУЛ СТАРОСТА.    - ИДИТЕ, ТОВАРИЩ ЗОВЕТ.    ОН ВСТАЛ И С ГУЛОМ В ГОЛОВЕ, ШАТАЯСЬ ОТ  СЛАБОСТИ,  ВЫБРАЛСЯ  В  ТЕМНЫЕ СЕНИ. СКВОЗЬ РАСКРЫТУЮ ДВЕРЬ НА СНЕЖНОМ ДВОРЕ БЫЛ ВИДЕН РЫБАК, У  ЕГО  НОГ ЛЕЖАЛА НА СНЕГУ ТЕМНАЯ ТУШКА ОВЦЫ, КОТОРУЮ ТОТ, КАЖЕТСЯ, СОБИРАЛСЯ ПОДНЯТЬ НА ПЛЕЧИ.    - ТАК. ТЫ ИДИ, - РОВНЫМ, БЕЗ НЕДАВНЕЙ НЕПРИЯЗНИ  ГОЛОСОМ  СКАЗАЛ  РЫБАК СТАРОСТЕ, - И ПРИКРОЙ ДВЕРЬ. НЕЧЕГО ГЛЯДЕТЬ.    СТАРОСТА, ПОХОЖЕ, ХОТЕЛ ЧТО-ТО СКАЗАТЬ, ДА, НАВЕРНО, РАЗДУМАЛ  И  МОЛЧА ПОВЕРНУЛСЯ К ДОМУ. СЕННАЯ ДВЕРЬ ЗА  НИМ  ПЛОТНО  ЗАКРЫЛАСЬ,  ПОТОМ  СЛЫШНО БЫЛО, КАК СТУКНУЛА ДВЕРЬ В ИЗБУ.    - ЧТО, ОТПУСКАЕШЬ? - СИПЛО СПРОСИЛ СОТНИКОВ, КОГДА ОНИ ВДВОЕМ  ОСТАЛИСЬ ПОСРЕДИ ДВОРА.    - А, ЧЕРТ С НИМ.    РЫБАК СИЛЬНЫМ РЫВКОМ ЗАБРОСИЛ НА ПЛЕЧО ОВЦУ И  ШАГНУЛ  ЗА  УГОЛ  САРАЯ, ОТТУДА СВЕРНУЛ ПО ЦЕЛИНЕ К ЗНАКОМОМУ ГУМНУ, КОСОБОКИЕ  ПОСТРОЙКИ  КОТОРОГО ТЕМНЕЛИ НЕВДАЛЕКЕ НА СНЕГУ.    СОТНИКОВ ПОТАЩИЛСЯ СЛЕДОМ.'''
